 ### Breakpoint Resume Configuration
Breakpoint Resume is designed to avoid persistent attachment fragments caused by upload interruptions, wasting disk space. Large attachments will be split into multiple fragments during upload and these fragments will be uploaded synchronously (To improve upload speed). If the upload fails or is interrupted, re-upload will resume from the last failed point and use the fragments generated from the previous upload (To reduce garbage files and save disk resources). The resume upload feature is only triggered when the uploaded attachment size exceeds the configured file size for resume upload, and the size of attachment fragments are also determined by configuration.
