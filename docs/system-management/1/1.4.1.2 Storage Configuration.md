#### Alibaba Cloud Storage
- **Alibaba Cloud Object Storage**: Obtain the Bucket account information from the Alibaba Cloud OSS Management Console. The configuration on the MK Digital Work Platform side is as follows:

Notes on switching to Alibaba Cloud storage or initial setup of Alibaba Cloud storage:
When the project uses third-party Alibaba Cloud storage for files, direct download must be enabled instead of   
Download using a stream proxy. The reasons are as follows: When dealing with large files, such as those exceeding 100MB,
Streaming downloads can easily cause the gateway interface to time out.
To address the above issues, the proposed solutions are as follows:
- Enable Alibaba Cloud direct download mode.
- Increase the gateway interface timeout period.

#### FastDFS Storage
- **FastDFS Storage**: Obtain the IP address and storage group name of the installed FastDFS service. The specific config on the MK Digital Work Platform side is as follows: 
- *** Tip: FastDFS services can be deployed in clusters, allowing multiple IP addresses to be configured in the service list, separated by commas. ***
