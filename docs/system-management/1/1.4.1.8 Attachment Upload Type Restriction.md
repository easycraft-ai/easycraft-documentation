 ### Attachment Upload Type Restriction
Users can designate the types of attachments that are not allowed to be uploaded. Multiple attachment types must be separated by English semicolon. For example, js;bat;exe;sh;cmd;jsp;jspx After configuring the type, business modules will be validated when uploading corresponding attachment types, prompting that upload is not allowed.
There are two options under "Attachment Upload Type Restriction", which are "Attachment types that are not allowed to upload" and "Attachment types that are allowed to upload". The restriction will be set as "Attachment types that are not allowed to upload" by default. 
There are also toggles for security validation.
