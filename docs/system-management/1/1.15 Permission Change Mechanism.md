## Permission Change Mechanism
Provides a unified management interface for permission changes, enabling batch update, create and replace maintainers and users for process templates, maintainers and users for categories, as well as readers and downloaders for process instances, etc.
- Authorize by data type, supporting the selection of categories, templates, and data.
- Authorize based on the data scope. If left empty, it applies to all active templates in the process platform. Supports changing only the selected scope, only the subcategories of the selected scope, or both the selected scope and its subcategories.
Change Type: Can be set to create, remove, or reset, with "create" selected by default. 
Modifiable Permission Type: users and maintainers. Specific permission items are loaded based on the selected data type.  
Execution configuration allows users to set the time period for scheduled execution and the data volume processed per batch. If the configured time period is exceeded, the task will be automatically interrupted and resume during the next execution.
