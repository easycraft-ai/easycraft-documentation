 ## Attachment Upload Source
Designate the priority source for file upload execution. If configure local disk as prior, the local disk file pop-up will open first when upload attachments. If configure Ding Disk as prior, Ding Disk will be used first when upload attachments. (Note: Ding Disk is only available when MK System integrates with DingTalk)
