 ### Application of Association Mechanism
Take system management as an example. When creating or editing a system, users can click "Associate Doc", input classification of association. Then select the process or system documents that can be associated, either through single-select or in batch, and click "Confirm" to associate.
After association, users can view the details, add or delete an associated document, and perform other operations.
