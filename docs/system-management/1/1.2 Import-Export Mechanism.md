## Import/Export Mechanism
Supports creating, editing, and deleting import/export data templates for different forms across various business modules, as well as adding fields for each business form type, differentiating between main table and sub table fields.
The downloaded import/export templates support multi-sheet scenarios for low-code businesses, including main tables, detail tables, and sub tables.
Currently, the business modules that support the import/export mechanism include Organization Management, Process Management, and Low-Code Applications.
