 ### Circulation Configuration
Recipients will receive "To-Do" message if the document is sent as "To-Do"; 
Recipients will receive "Review & Handle" message if the document is sent as "Review & Hnadle". 
Note: "Review & Handle" is the sub-level of "All Pending", therefore, "Review & Handle" documents can be found in "All Pending" list.
Sending Method: Can select "To-Do" or "Read & Handle". "To-Do" is checked by default.
Authorized Circulation Organization: Used for template-level control of the selected organization scope for circulation recipients. Users can select full organization structure, own organization, own department, or customize. "Full Organization Structure" is set by default.
Circulated by Recipient: When enabled, recipients can circulate to others.  
Personnel Only: When enabled, documents can only be circulated to personnel.
