## Read Configuration
Reading configuration refers to the preview settings for attachments. Normally, the use of capability for preview will be determined based on the enabled capabilities and their configured sort in the preview settings. 
But when reading rules are configured, the capabilities and methods designated by the configured rules will be prioritized, regardless of how the document preview is configured. 
Reading rules configuration supports operations such as create, edit, disable, enable, and delete.
Note: The configuration must follow two rules:
- Only one preview service provider is allowed for the same module and attachment type.  
- Only one record can exist for the same attachment type and preview service provider across different modules.
