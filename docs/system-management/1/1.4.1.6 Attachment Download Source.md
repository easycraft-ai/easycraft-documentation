 ### Attachment Download Source
Designate the priority source for file download execution. If configure local disk as prior, the local disk file pop-up will open first when download attachments. If configure Ding Disk as prior, Ding Disk will be used first when download attachments. (Note: Ding Disk is only available when MK System integrates with DingTalk)
