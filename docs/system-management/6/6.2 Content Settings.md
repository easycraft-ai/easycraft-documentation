 ## Content Settings
Name and Phone Number are default settings provided by the system. Click "Add" to add more settings. Except for constants, other items cannot be added repeatedly. Added content can be deleted, dragged to sort, or formatted. The default constant content is "01". 
The format of the watermark is "Phone Number + Name", but it will not be displayed when the Phone Number is left empty.
