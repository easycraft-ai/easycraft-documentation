### 2.3.2 Domain Model Design

Administrators can access the `Low-Code Platform → Domain Model` and add domain models using the **Create** operation in the left-side category tree. They can also assign authorized users and maintainers for permission control.

After creation, the domain model design page will open. Here, users can drag **aggregate groups** (i.e., applications) and **entities** (i.e., forms) from the left-side element designer into the right-side designer. Different aggregate groups can be distinguished by varying theme colors, while the entity colors will correspond to their parent aggregate group.

Entities can configure association relationships with one another through connections, which can be:

- One-to-One  
- One-to-Many  
- Many-to-One  
- Many-to-Many

#### Examples of Association Relationships:

- **One-to-One**:  
  The "Account" table has a field called **Assigned Employee**, and the "Employee" table has a field called **Employee ID**. One account corresponds to only one employee ID, and one employee has only one account.  
  → The "Account" table and the "Employee" table have a **one-to-one** association relationship.

- **Many-to-One**:  
  The "Employee" table has a **Primary Department** field. An employee can belong to only one primary department, but a department can have multiple employees.  
  → The "Employee" table and the "Department" table have a **many-to-one** relationship.

- **Many-to-Many**:  
  The "Employee" table has a **Position** field. One employee can hold multiple positions, and one position can be held by multiple employees.  
  → The "Employee" table and the "Position" table have a **many-to-many** relationship.

- **One-to-Many** (reverse of many-to-one):  
  The **Employees under main department** field in the "Department" table is calculated based on the **Main department** field in the "Employee" table.  
  → This represents a **one-to-many** relationship.

After completing the design of aggregate groups, entities, and association relationships, users can generate corresponding forms in the application and data model with one click via **Generate Model**:

- **Aggregate groups** generate **applications**
- **Entities** generate **data models**

After the model is generated, the system automatically redirects to the `Low-Code Platform → Application Management` list page, with the newly generated application highlighted.
