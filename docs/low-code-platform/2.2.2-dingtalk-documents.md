### 2.2.2 DingTalk Documents

Administrators can configure DingTalk documents, which act as a knowledge base created within the DingTalk integration, to store documents, spreadsheets, and mind maps.  
Admins can access the `Low-Code Platform → App Ops → DingTalk Documents Configuration` section, specify a DingTalk document library, and save the configuration. After this, any newly created documents will be stored in the designated knowledge base.

Once the DingTalk document library is specified, administrators can navigate to the `Low-Code Platform → Business Design` section. The left side of the page displays categories that load the current system's Low-Code app categories along with their application names, presenting them as primary and secondary classifications. Newly added app categories and names will be automatically synchronized. Users can choose different categories to create new documents, spreadsheets, or mind maps.

> **Note**: The use of DingTalk Documents requires certain prerequisites:
> - The integration platform must have the **DingTalk Integration** deployed and enabled.
> - Organization synchronization must be successful.
> - DingTalk integration administrators must create knowledge bases, add members, and configure document permissions.
>
> Refer to the "DingTalk Integration" documentation for details. Only when these prerequisites are met can users create, view, and delete documents normally.

### 2.2.3 Structure Design

Before building an application system, administrators can create graphical design descriptions using various architectural frameworks, including:
- Business Architecture
- Application Architecture
- Data Architecture
- Technical Architecture
- Security Architecture

Administrators can enter the `Low-Code Platform → Business Design` and select the **Architecture Design** tab to access the architecture design card list page. The left side of this page displays a classification tree that loads the current system's Low-Code app categories and application names, with new additions synchronized automatically. Users can select different categories to perform creation operations.

To create a new architecture:
- Click **Create** in the upper right corner to open the Create Business Architecture dialog.
- Select different architecture types.
- Specify the corresponding authorized users and maintainers.

After entering the editing page, various graphic components provided on the left can be dragged into the design area on the right for layout and design.

DingTalk documents, mind maps, tables, and architecture design documents can be linked to business design applications via options in the lower right corner of the application section.

By clicking **Associate Document**, users can select existing DingTalk documents and design documents in the **Associated Document** dialog. The list provides options to:
- View details by title.
- Cancel associations.

Conversely, DingTalk documents and the architecture design section include entry points to view referenced associated documents, allowing users to see which applications reference these documents.

## 2.3 Domain Model

For complex application systems, domain model design can be conducted after finalizing the design documentation. This involves using **aggregate groups** and **entities** in the domain model to establish the foundational configurations and relationships for multiple applications and forms.
