### 2.5.5 Authorization Mgt

Authorization management is available after enabling multi-service mode. It primarily displays unused authorization data created by administrators. Service administrators can view, modify or delete unused authorizations from the list and can also create temporary authorizations on this page. Authorized users can view and utilize the data assigned to them through the list and can create a new application using an authorization. Once an authorization is used, it will no longer appear in the list.

- **New/Creat Authorization**: Set the basic information for the authorization, including the authorization name, authorized personnel, runtime service, database, and authorization description.
- **Edit**: The information on this page is consistent with the "New/Creat Authorization" page, but only the authorization name, authorized personnel, and authorization description can be modified.
- **Delete**: Once deleted, the authorization will be removed from the list.
- **Use**: By utilizing an authorization, an app can be created under the runtime service and database specified by the administrator. Authorized users cannot modify the runtime service or database information when using the authorization.
