## 2.9.5 DEV

The application's management console (DEV: development) provides unified management of various configuration items, including forms, reports, charts, pages, scenarios, action flows, and settings menu items.

### 2.9.5.1 Overview
On the overview page, users can generate data model diagrams for all forms in the current application with one click. For the generation process and design operations, refer to section 2.4 Data Model.

### 2.9.5.2 Regular Form
"Reegular Form" primarily manages and configures the created form data. Configuration options include: views, business operations, mechanism deployment, IM integration, default permissions, parameter settings, form external links, and form information.

#### 2.9.5.2.1 Display Mode

##### 2.9.5.2.1.1 Column Pattern
When accessing DEV—form , the created forms are displayed in split view mode by default, users can change by clicking "Mode" in upper left corner. The right panel shows the forms, while the central area displays form views and configuration menu items.

The form supports delete and hide operations. When hovering over the "..." on the left form menu, hide and delete options will appear. At the bottom of the left menu, there is a toggle to show hidden items. Turn it on to display hidden forms.

When users need to sort a form, hover over the "↑↓" icon. The following options will appear: sort by update time (descending), update time (ascending), creation time (descending), creation time (ascending), sequence number (descending), and sequence number (ascending). Select the appropriate sorting option as needed.

##### 2.9.5.2.1.2 List Mode
When hovering over the "Mode" option in the left form menu, users'll see options for split view mode, list mode, and grid mode. To switch to list mode, simply click "List Mode."

In list mode, users can also perform operations like creating or deleting forms.

##### 2.9.5.2.1.3 Grid Layout
When hovering over the "Mode" option in the left form menu, users will see options for Split View Mode, List Mode, and Grid Mode. To switch to List Mode, click "List Mode."

In Grid Mode, users can also perform operations such as creating new forms or deleting forms.

#### 2.9.5.2.2 View
Under "View," users will find form view, detail view, and data list view (including: table view, card view, Gantt chart, kanban view, and calendar view).

##### 2.9.5.2.2.1 View
After a form is saved or published, a card view of the form is generated. When the form is published, the card displays a "Published" status; when the form is only saved, it shows a "Draft" status. Hover over the form view and click "Edit" to enter the form design page. For detailed information on form design, refer to section 2.9.2 Form Design.

##### 2.9.5.2.2.2 Data Detail View
Detail View refers to the page that displays the detailed form of data when a single data point is clicked from the view. The system includes a built-in view named "Default View" when a form is published. If there is only one default view, it cannot be deleted but can be edited. Click "Create" to create additional views as needed. The number in parentheses indicates the total number of views.

When multiple detail views are created, users can delete them.

###### 2.9.5.2.2.2.1 Business Operations
Business operations (Operation Buttons) are actions that can be performed in the detail view, with preset buttons for Edit, Print, and Delete.

**Conditional Judgment**
For scenarios where business operation buttons should only appear under specific conditions, users can set conditional logic in the settings. For example, the Delete button is only available when the document status is "Draft." Users can set it up as shown below: configure conditional logic—the "Delete" button will only appear if the document status is set to "Draft." Additionally, it supports formula definition settings, allowing users to call formulas to configure the corresponding conditions.

**Create Action Button**
Operation buttons support two forms: one with a view and one without. For specific configuration methods of operation buttons, please refer to: 2.9.5.2.3.2 Create New Business Operation.

###### 2.9.5.2.2.2.2 Business Tag
Business table tags are displayed on the details page. By default, process handling, permissions, and change records are shown. Users can also configure data related to the current form, such as displaying project phases, project risks, and project summaries on the project ledger view page.

**Add Business Tag**
To help business personnel quickly view related data, users can add lists or forms associated with the current form. Take the example of adding project plan list information as a business table tag in the project register.

**Settings:**
a) Select "List" as the type and search for the corresponding data source in the view.
b) If the data source list has input parameter settings set, configuration is required. For details, please refer to the common parameters of the data list view.
c) Set the display range, i.e., viewing permissions.

**Form Settings:**
Select the view option under the specific form, supporting cross-application selection. To add a "Project Initiation" form tag on the "Project Ledger" page, follow these steps:
a) Click the "Add Tag" button and input the tag name;
b) Select "form" as the type and set up the form view and configuration parameters:
   i. Use "View" to select the form to be displayed. Note that the forms configurable here are limited to those associated with the current form through business association widgets.
   ii. "Settings" primarily set the query field information. When the same field information is found in "Project Initiation," the data is returned as the business tag for the project ledger display.

**Default Tag**
The system includes four default tags: Process Handling, Permissions, Change Records, and Access Statistics. Users can configure the display scope, i.e., tag scope permissions.
- The process handling tag allows users to view approval records, process estimates, process status, flowcharts, and process logs on the front end.
- Permissions primarily display the access levels of readers and editors.
- Change records primarily display the modification history of all fields in the form.
- Access statistics primarily display the viewing records of the document.
- The business tag supports linking reports and charts, allowing users to view them when accessing the view.

###### 2.9.5.2.2.2.3 View Basic Settings
This section introduces the three display modes of views: bottom tags, top tags, and grouped tags.

**Bottom Tag**
View tags are displayed at the bottom of the page, with styles including basic and card formats, as shown in the image below.

**Top Tag**
Tags are displayed at the top of the page, with switching methods including normal switching and waterfall switching, and styles divided into basic and card formats.

Waterfall Toggle: When clicking on form details, permissions, or access statistics, the page scrolls down to position the corresponding tag.

**Group Tags**
Tags are displayed at the top of the page, with display options including horizontal and vertical, defaulting to horizontal.

##### 2.9.5.2.2.3 Data List View
After the form is published, a data list view of the form will be automatically generated. When there is only one data list view, it cannot be deleted but can be edited. Click "New" to create additional data list views as needed. The number in parentheses next to the data list view indicates the quantity of views. The types of data list views include: table view, Gantt chart, card view, kanban view, and calendar view. For configuration details of these views, refer to section 2.3.4 Data List Views.

When multiple data list views are created, users can delete the views.

###### 2.9.5.2.2.3.1 Public Parameters
Common parameters can be added in the basic settings of data list view. These defined common parameters can be referenced in statistics and data filtering, and configured as input parameters in tree view definitions, category trees, and action flow.

Scenario: 1) Filter data with identical names using common parameters.
2) Fill the classification values from the left side of the tree view into the new view on the right side of the list.

Business operations are the operational buttons on a form. Users can configure built-in operation buttons in the settings. If the built-in operations are insufficient, users can also create new business operation buttons.

#### 2.9.5.2.3 Application Scenario
- On the employee activity information page, add a "Sign Up" button to enable users to register quickly.
- On the meeting information page, add a "Meeting Minutes" button to enable users to submit meeting minutes.
- On the project ledger page, add a "Project Plan" button to enable users to conveniently submit project plans.

##### 2.9.5.2.3.2 Create New Business Operation
When built-in operations cannot meet business requirements, users can create new business operation buttons to address this.

**Example Scenario:** On the employee activity information page, add a "Register" button to enable users to sign up quickly.

**Effect:** On the event information page, open the registration form directly with a button.

**Instructions:**
a) Click the "Create" button in the top right corner.
b) Configure on the "Add Operation" page: configuration
   i. Set the button name to "Register";
   ii. Select the usage location as "View Mode," which allows the registration operation to be performed via a button when viewing form data;
   iii. Select the operation view as "With View," meaning clicking "Register" will open a new registration form;
   iv. Select page: Mainly sets the settings source for the form to be opened.
c) Configuration process: If the form for the new view has a process, the relevant process needs to be selected.
d) Parameter passing settings: To improve user form-filling efficiency, configuration can be set to directly assign current form data to the new view's form.

##### 2.9.5.2.3.3 Edit Business Operations
Based on business needs, settings can be configured for both built-in operations and newly created operations.

**Built-in operations:** The list displays the system's nine default built-in business operations, categorized as "Built-in Operations." The "Create," "Batch Delete," "Import," and "Export" functions are used for data list views, while the remaining operations are for detail views. Built-in operations cannot be deleted but can be edited—including renaming, settings permissions, binding business triggers, and adding prompts.

a) **Allowed users:** specifies who can use this operation. If left empty, only administrators can use it.
b) **Business trigger:** Supports binding trigger actions or trigger scenarios, which are executed when performing business operations.
c) **Execution method:** Synchronous—all business triggers are executed simultaneously; Asynchronous—primarily used for business triggers that call integration methods. Due to the large data volume, the form is submitted first, followed by the execution of the integration method.
d) **Hover prompt:** The hint message displayed when hovering the mouse over the operation button.

**Create operation:** Configuration items that differ from built-in operations are detailed below.
a) **Usage Location:** Configure the available locations for business operations, supporting "data list view" or "Detail View".
b) **Operation View:** Determines whether a business operation requires opening an operation view. If "With View" is selected, choose a page below—options include data list view, Detail View, or new view. If "Without View" is selected, no page selection is required below.
   i. **Select View:** Choose App > Form > View > View, primarily used to view form data, such as reviewing project risk information during project phases.
   ii. **Select "Create New View":** Go to App > Form > Create > View, primarily used for creating new data, such as adding a registration button on an activity information page.
   iii. **Select list view:** Choose App-Form-List-Data List View, primarily used to view list data, such as checking vehicle information for a fleet.
c) **New Process:** If the selected form has a process, the "New Process" box will be displayed with a dropdown menu to select the process.
d) **Default Value:** When creating new data, the current form data is assigned to the form in the new view.

##### 2.9.5.2.3.4 Permissions Settings
Permissions are primarily used for batch settings of business operation button permissions. After selecting the corresponding options, proceed with the following settings:
- **Add:** Assign additional personnel to the existing permission configuration.
- **Reset:** Replace the original permission with new ones.
- **User Assignment:** Authorize operations by selecting the corresponding personnel or organizations.

#### 2.9.5.2.4 Mechanism Deployment

##### 2.9.5.2.4.1 Import/Export Mechanism

##### 2.9.5.2.4.2 Printing Mechanism
When we need to print entered data, we can use custom templates for personalized printing or print directly using built-in templates, making it easier to view and manage the data.

There are two types of printing templates:
**Built-in templates:** Each business form comes with a built-in template.
**Custom templates:** Users can create custom print templates and design the print widgets users need.

When a custom template is set as the default, it will be prioritized when printing form data; otherwise, the built-in template will be used.

In process scenarios, different custom print templates can be selected at various process nodes to print documents with different data or formats as needed.

**Using print templates:** Click on an existing form entry to view its details, then click "Print" in the upper-right corner and select a printing device.

On the print interface, both built-in and custom templates include an "Export to PDF" feature for exporting files as PDFs. Configuring print templates: Configure the templates to be printed, with support for drag-and-drop fields.

### 2.9.5.3 Category template model
The "Category Template Model" and "Simple Category Model" (abb. to Category Forms) primarily manage and configure created classification forms. The difference from regular forms lies in the configuration items, which are categorized into: view, mechanism deployment, business operations, configuration items, permission settings, and form information. For features shared with regular forms, please refer to the description above. The following focuses on configuration of categorized forms.

#### 2.9.5.3.1 Mechanism Deployment

##### 2.9.5.3.1.1 Form Design
The form design mechanism applies to templates created based on the category template model and simple category model. Enabled by default, this mechanism automatically loads form fields from the category form when creating a new template. These automatically loaded form fields cannot be modified or deleted. Additionally, new form fields can be dragged into templates. These fields can be modified, deleted, or deactivated, with different templates configured for different new fields.

The form design mechanism can also be turned off, but either it or the process mechanism must remain active. When the form mechanism is disabled and the process mechanism is enabled, the form design page does not appear during new template creation. The system defaults to loading the form design page of the categorized form, while process design can be configured separately.

The Category Template Form Designer also provides version restoration capability. When widgets are added, removed, or have their properties modified in form design—resulting in a new version V2—users can revert to version V1 using the "Restore This Version" option.

##### 2.9.5.3.1.2 Process Design
The process design mechanism applies to templates created based on the category template model and simple category model. By default, the process design mechanism is disabled, and new templates use the classification form's process. If a template requires its own custom process, the process mechanism must be enabled to configure the template process separately.

#### 2.9.5.3.2 Config Items
After the category template model and simple category model forms are created, configuration items can be added (configuration items are essentially form designs). Once the configuration form is published, a configuration items tab will appear when creating new templates based on this classification form. When creating or editing a template, values for configuration items can be filled in. Configuration items for each template are stored independently.

When creating a template for a new form category, configuration tabs will appear at the top, allowing values to be assigned to configuration item fields.

After assigning values to configuration fields and publishing them, they can be provided to form rules, data list views, AND/OR components in view modes, business operations, and action flows to retrieve configuration items and make judgments based on their values.

### 2.9.5.4 Charts
The charts in the development (DEV) allow users to view all existing chart data for the current application. Users can edit or create new charts for streamlined management. For chart configurations, refer to the "Chart Platform Manual"

When hovering over a chart card, clicking "Edit" will jump to chart editing page. Additionally, actions such as "Disable" and "Delete" can be performed.

### 2.9.5.5 Page
Under the "Pages" menu, users can view all created page data for the current application, enabling unified management. Users can also create new page data, as the app design page can reference page data created under the DEV - Pages menu. For creating pages, refer to section 2.9.1.1.3 "Create Page."

When hovering over a page card, actionable options will appear. Click "Edit" to navigate to the page editing interface where users can redesign the page. "Basic Info (Basic Information)" displays the page name, authorized viewers, creator, and creation date, and allows users to modify the page name and viewing permissions. Click "Copy" to duplicate the page and its configuration for reuse, eliminating redundant setup. Click "Delete" to remove the page. If the page is deleted after being configured in the app design menu, it will show as missing.

### 2.9.5.6 Action Flow
Action flow enables the orchestration and design of different business scenarios, facilitating data transfer between multiple applications (A/B/C) or forms. The action flow list displays all created action flows, presenting data in a card view with scroll loading. Users can filter data by the startup method of the action flow. Click "Process Design" to enter the action flow editing canvas. Unpublished action flows default to draft status, while published ones are in enabled status. Enabled action flows can be disabled (they won't execute even if conditions are met when disabled), and disabled action flows can be re-enabled.

The action flow can be exported with the app and then imported into other environments. The action flow properties and associated forms can be exported and imported synchronously, no need for additional configuration.

#### 2.9.5.6.1 Canvas Area
The Canvas Area provides a space for arranging and designing action flows. Users can position nodes and design execution sequences as needed. After selecting a type, users can enter the action flow design area, which includes default start and end nodes. The canvas supports zooming in and out. The action flow type can be changed (Click "Change Type" in upper right corner) before saving (e.g., switching from a scheduled startup type to a data listener type if needed).

**Undo:** Undoing the previous operation, with a maximum of 10 steps.
**Redo:** Redoing the last undo operation, with a maximum of 10 steps.
**Align:** Aligns selected nodes with options such as top alignment, vertical center alignment, and horizontal center alignment.
**Delete:** Deletes the selected nodes. Start and end nodes cannot be deleted, but all other nodes can be deleted.
**Check:** Identify errors and unfilled items in the action flow.
**Save:** Saves the action flow, which remains in draft status after saving.
**Publish:** Once the action flow design is completed, publish it to enable the action flow.

The left node area displays various function nodes. When a node is selected, its properties are shown on the right, allowing for corresponding configuration as needed. Selecting the start node and then clicking a node on the left will automatically add it after the start node. It also supports dragging function nodes directly into the canvas design area.

The canvas area also provides "Process Variables" configuration. Process variables can define initial values and be used in conjunction with subsequent data nodes, basic nodes, advanced nodes, and business nodes.

#### 2.9.5.6.2 Start Node
"Start" nodes are categorized into: Scheduled Startup, Data Listener, Event Listener, and Manual Trigger types. The type of the start node corresponds to the action flow type. When creating an action flow and entering the canvas area, a start node is automatically added. The start node's code cannot be modified, nor can the start node be deleted. The type can be switched before saving the action flow.

image : Start Node

##### 2.9.5.6.2.1 Scheduled Startup
Scheduled Startup (triggers) are triggered cyclically based on the set period to execute configuration nodes (e.g., adding data, updating data). When creating an action flow, select the "Scheduled Startup" type. The action flow will be triggered and running at the set time.

Selecting the "Scheduled Startup" node allows users to configuration the task name, code, start time, frequency, execution conditions, termination conditions, and error handling strategy. The "Start time" can be configured as needed, but only a time after the current time can be selected. The "Scheduled Frequency" options include: once (executes only once), hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or by Cron expression.

For the frequency, select "hourly." The execution conditions can be set to run every few hours or at specified times (selectable range: 00:00 to 23:00).

If the scheduled frequency is set to "daily," the execution conditions can be configured to run every few days, with a minimum interval of 1 day.

When selecting "Weekly" as the frequency, users can choose which day of the week to execute. For example, if users select Monday and set the start time to 9:00, the configured action flow task will execute every Monday at 9:00.

When the frequency is set to "Monthly," the execution condition can be set to "Every Month" or "Designated Months." If "Every Month" is selected and then "By Day," users can choose specific dates for each month. If "Every Month" is selected and then "Weekly" users can choose the day of the week and the week number for each month. When selecting "Designated Month," user can choose a specific month and date to execute the scheduled task.

When selecting "By Cron Expression" as the sscheduled frequency, users need to enter the Cron expression. For example: "0 0 18 * * ? *" means the task will run daily at 18:00. Clicking "Generate the lastest Execution Times" will display the last 10 scheduled execution times.

The end condition can be set to "Limit Times," "End by Date," or "No End." If "Limit Times" is selected, users can specify how many times the action flow will run before ending. If "End by Date" is selected, users can set an end date. If "No End" is selected, the scheduled action flow will run indefinitely.

The "Delay Policy" determines whether missed scheduled tasks will be processed after a system restart or downtime. By default, missed executions are not processed, meaning scheduled tasks will not be compensated after a restart. If "Continue execution after delay" is enabled, missed scheduled tasks will be compensated after a restart.

##### 2.9.5.6.2.2 Data Listener
Data listener is primarily used to track changes in form data. A data listener-type action flow continuously "listens" the configured form. Once the form data changes (including additions, updates, or deletions), it automatically executes the predefined series of actions.

The "Trigger form" can be the main table, sub table, detail table, or sub-detail table within an application. The trigger timing can be set to: after creating data (the action flow will be triggered when new data is added to the selected form), after updating data (the action flow will be triggered when data in the selected form is updated), or after deleting data (the action flow will be triggered when data is deleted from the selected trigger form).

##### 2.9.5.6.2.3 Manual Trigger
Manual triggering executes the action flow through behaviors specified by other modules, primarily exposing the action flow for external calls, which can be triggered via buttons, processes, or APIs.

The trigger type can be selected from: operation trigger, process trigger, or API trigger. Users can choose to bind or unbind forms. The data type can be set to "single record" or "multiple records." "View reference relationships" shows where this action flow is referenced.

##### 2.9.5.6.2.4 Event Listener
Event listener automatically executes a predefined series of actions by detecting events generated by system applications.

The event listener start node can be choose between built-in events and custom events. Built-in events can be Low-Code form events or process form events, while custom events come from the integration platform.

#### 2.9.5.6.3 Data Node
The data node primarily performs operations on form data, such as adding, querying, or deleting data. Data nodes include: adding data, querying data, updating data, filtering data, deleting data, and adding or updating nodes.

##### 2.9.5.6.3.1 Add Data
The "Add Data" node can automatically add a new entry to the specified form. When combined with the context of "Query Data," "Filter Data," "Data Listener," "Manual Trigger," "Add Data," "Update Data," or "Add or Update" nodes, it can perform batch data addition.

The name and code of the "Add Data" node can be modified as needed. The "Target Form" indicates which form to add data to. The binding node can select the node before adding data: Start Node > Data Listener > After Data Creation, Start Node > Data Listener > After Data Update, Start Node > Manual Trigger > Operation Trigger, Query Data, Add Data, Filter Data, Update Data, or Add or Update.

When no node is bound, the available options for form field settings are only: fixed value, null value, formula editor. When the bound node selects data from a previous node, the form field can be set by choosing "Trigger Form Field," and users can also click "Automatically Match other feild" to automatically configure the form field settings.

When the selected target form has a process, the "Select process" configuration option will appear. Choose the corresponding process. The submission method can be either "Manual Submission" or "Automatic Submission." Manual Submission: After creating new data, it is temporarily saved as a draft and remains at the drafting stage. Automatic Submission: After creating new data, it automatically skips the drafting stage and proceeds directly to the first approval step.

##### 2.9.5.6.3.2 Query Data
By querying data nodes, users can retrieve single or multiple form data (data from the main table or detail table), then filter or sort this data for use by other nodes.

The name and code of the "Query Data" node can be modified as needed. The query object should be configured with the form from which user wants to retrieve data. Data filtering can be configured as needed (e.g., filtering to select only female employees). The sorting field arranges the filtered data in ascending or descending order. The return types are: single record or multiple records (with a maximum of 1000 rows supported).

##### 2.9.5.6.3.3 Update Data
The name and code of the "Update Data" node can be modified as needed. The "Update Node" can select the following nodes preceding the "Update Data" node: Start Node > Data Listener > After Data Creation, Start Node > Data Listener > After Data Update, Start Node > Manual Trigger > Operation Trigger, Query Data Node, Add Data Node, Filter Data, Update Data, Add or Update Node. The update field settings can be configured using "Formula Editor", "Null", or "Fixed Value". Update data is used to modify one or multiple field values (in the current table or related tables) of a record. It can update to new content, clear field values, or add/decrease values (numeric or currency).

##### 2.9.5.6.3.4 Filter Data
The name and code of the "Filter Data" node can be modified as needed. The "Filter Node" in "Filter Data" can combine contexts from: Query Data, Filter Data, Data Listener, Manual Trigger, Add Data, Update Data, and Add or Update nodes to filter data. The Filter Data node enables secondary data filtering for use by subsequent nodes. Filter rules are configured via the formula editor, supporting expression mode, script template, and advanced mode.

##### 2.9.5.6.3.5 Delete Data
"Delete Data" can automatically remove data from selected nodes. The node's name and code can be modified as needed. "Delete Node" can select from the following preceding nodes: Start Node > Data Listener > After Data Creation, Start Node > Data Listener > After Data Update, Start Node > Manual Trigger > Operation Trigger, Query Data Node, Add Data Node, Filter Data, Update Data, or Add/Update Node.

##### 2.9.5.6.3.6 Add or Update
"Add or Update" combines the functions of adding and updating nodes, automatically inserting new data or updating existing data in a specified form. It can also batch add or update data by integrating with the contexts of "Query Data," "Filter Data," "Add Data," "Update Data," "Data Listener," and "Manual Trigger" nodes.

The Add or Update node searches for target form data matching the conditions configured in "Query Target." If no match is found, it adds new data; otherwise, it updates the existing data.

For the configuration and usage of other fields in the Add or Update node, refer to the Add Node.

#### 2.9.5.6.4 Basic Node

##### 2.9.5.6.4.1 Message Node (Reminder)
The name and code of the "Message Node" can be modified as needed to send notifications to designated recipients, supporting methods such as tasks, emails, DingTalk, and WeCom (Enterprise WeChat). The "Send Node" supports selection from the following options: Start Node > Data Listener > After Data Creation, Start Node > Data Listener > After Data Update, Start Node > Maunal Trigger > Operation Trigger, Query Data Node, Add Data Node, Filter Data, Update Data, Add or Update. Recipients support fixed values and formula definitions. Fixed values: selected from the address book. Formula definitions: selected from the formula editor, with the context passed by the selected node. Content links can be set to "View Mode," "Edit Mode," or "Other Links."

##### 2.9.5.6.4.2 Message Delete
Currently, when the system action flow sends a to-do message through the "Message Reminder" node, the recipient must edit the document to clear the to-do message. The system does not allow users to clear the to-do message by simply clicking a button on the page or viewing the details. To address the above scenario, a "Message Delete" node is added. By using the event codes in the "Message Reminder" and "Message Delete" nodes, pending messages with specified event codes can be cleared.

Special Note: The "Message Delete" node must be used in conjunction with the "Message Reminder" node (event codes must be specified). Messages must be sent first before they can be cleared.

**Example Scenario:** During an employee event, relevant personnel are invited to register for participation. The invitees will receive a to-do notification. If the event is canceled due to special circumstances, the system will send a cancellation notice while marking the invitees' to-do notifications as completed.

**Implementation Effect:** When the administrator clicks the "Cancel Event" on the event details page, the system will send a cancellation notification and simultaneously clear the pending tasks previously assigned to the invited participants.

**Instructions:**
Step 1: Configure the data listener action flow: Set up an action flow to send to-do messages to invited personnel after the event is created. The "Message Reminder" node must specify an event code to distinguish it from other pending messages.
Step 2: Configuration of the active trigger action flow: When the activity initiator clicks "Cancel Activity" on the details page, in addition to sending a to-be-read message, the previously sent to-do will also be marked as completed based on the event code.
Step 3: Configuration the business operation button "Cancel Activity" on the activity details page and bind it to the action flow in Step 2. When the event organizer clicks "Cancel Event" on the event details page, the invitee's to-do item will be marked as completed according to the configuration.

##### 2.9.5.6.4.3 Conditional Branch
The name and code of the "Conditional Branch" node can be modified as needed. By filtering through branch nodes, data in different states will follow different branch processes. Once all executable branches are completed, they will converge and continue executing the main process. The "Conditional Branch" settings support formula definitions and matching rules.

The flow method can be set to "Single-Branch Execution" or "Multi-Branch Execution." When conditions do not match, it can be configured to proceed to the node connected to the branch node.

##### 2.9.5.6.4.4 Loop Node
The name and code of the "Loop Node" can be modified as needed. Its main function is to execute the configuration nodes within the loop according to the defined looping method (which supports arrays, organizations, time, or counts). Process variables allow for defining variables and passing the main process's context parameters to sub-processes. In the top-left corner of the canvas area, users can switch between the main process and loop processes. The available loop methods include: array loop, organizational loop, time loop, and count loop. Array loop: Executes sequentially based on the referenced node array variable, exiting the loop upon completion. Organizational loop: Supports iteration through selected personnel, positions, departments, or institutions from the directoty picker. Time loop: Supports iteration through a specified time range (e.g., selecting 2023/2/16-2023/2/19 will execute 3 times). Count loop: Requires entering a positive integer (e.g., entering 5 will execute the loop 5 times).

##### 2.9.5.6.4.5 Sub-action
The "Sub-action" combines pre-configured and reusable action flows, and only action flows of the "Manual Trigger" type can be selected. The node name and code can be modified as needed. The input parameter configuration can be set using either the "Parameter Mapper" or "Formula Editor."

#### 2.9.5.6.5 Advanced Node

##### 2.9.5.6.5.1 Integrated Interface
The integration function of the "Integration Interface" can select either the "Integration Interface" or "Connection Flow" of the integration platform. The input parameter mapping can be configured using either the "Parameter Mapper" or "Formula Editor." By directly calling the "Integration Interface," the retrieved data can be utilized by subsequent nodes.

##### 2.9.5.6.5.2 Query Statistics
The "Query Statistics" node is primarily used to query data, summarize the queried data, and perform grouped statistics for use by subsequent nodes. The node type can be selected as "query" or "statistics." When selecting "query," there will be configurations for data filtering, sorting fields, return fields, and return type.

When the node type is set to "statistics," there will be configuration options for statistical dimensions, statistical items, sorting fields, and return types.

##### 2.9.5.6.5.3 Conversion Node
The "Conversion Node" can create temporary variables or synchronize context as output parameters. It recalculates the output results through parameter mapping configuration and provides the transformed values for subsequent nodes.

There are two methods for parameter mapping in the transformation node: the Parameter Mapper and the Formula editor.

##### 2.9.5.6.5.4 Assignment Node
The "Assignment Node" works with process variables to assign values to them. If the selected process variable is an array, users can also choose to append, update, or remove duplicates from the array. The process variable assignments from the assignment node can be used in the field configuration of subsequent nodes.

##### 2.9.5.6.5.5 Internal Interface
The "Internal Interface" node is primarily used to call API services created by the integration platform, and the retrieved data can be utilized by subsequent nodes. For internal interfaces, users can choose between "Internal API" or "Development API," and for input parameter mapping, users can select either "Parameter Mapper" or "Formula Editor."

##### 2.9.5.6.5.6 Create Process
The "Create Process" node can automatically add new process data to the specified process template.

The node name and code of the "Create Process" node can be modified. The process template can be selected from the published templates in process management. The process title value comes from the Formula editor. The creator can be a single person from the organizational structure or derived from the Formula editor. Submission methods include "Manual Submission" and "Automatic Submission." Manual Submission: After creating the data, it is saved as a draft and remains at the drafting stage. Automatic Submission: After creating the data, it skips the drafting stage and proceeds directly to the first approval step.

#### 2.9.5.6.6 End Node
The End Node corresponds to the Start Node. Similarly, there are end nodes for scheduled startup, data listeners, event listeners, and manual triggers. The end node of a manually triggered action flow supports output parameter definitions, whereas the end nodes of scheduled startup, data listener, and event listener action flows do not support output parameter definitions.

#### 2.9.5.6.7 Scenario Example

**Key Steps for Creating Business Scenarios**
Step 1: Select the start node and configure the trigger method
Step 2: Configure the nodes to be executed in the action flow
Step 3: Configure each node during execution
Step 4: Publish Action Flow
Step 5: Verify if it is effective

##### 2.9.5.6.7.1 Data Listener Application
**Implementation Scenario:** The company's sales management application includes two forms: sales leads and a customer main table. When new data is added to the sales leads, a data listener-type action flow can automatically add a customer record to the customer main table.

**Instructions:**
a) Go to the DEV action flow menu, click "Create" to create an action flow.
b) Enter the action flow type selection interface and choose the "Data Listener" type.
c) Configure the start node of the action flow, trigger the form selection "XXX (Sales Lead)" and set the trigger time to "After Creating Data".
d) The name of the new data node can be modified to: Add Data - Customer Main Table, to easily identify the node's function. Select "Customer Main Table" as the target form, bind the node to "Start Node (N1)," and configure the form fields to trigger the corresponding form fields.
e) After configuring the start node, add data node, and action flow name, click "Publish"—the action flow can only be officially enabled after being published. If there are required fields left blank when clicking "Check" or "Publish," corresponding prompts will appear.
f) After publish, users can view the newly published action flow in the action flow list.
g) When the application is running in the homepage, a new customer record will be automatically added to the customer main table whenever a user creates new sales lead data.

##### 2.9.5.6.7.2 Scheduled Startup Application
**Implementation scenario:** The company's sales management application includes a service ticket form that stores service ticket data. By using the scheduled startup node, unresolved service tickets are automatically sent to the assigned handler every morning at 9:00.

**Instructions:**
a) Go to the DEV, click "Create" to create an action flow, and select the "Scheduled Startup" type.
b) Configure the start node of the scheduled action flow, set the startup rule to begin at 9:00, select "Daily" for the sccheduled frequency, configure the execution condition as "Execute once every day," and choose "No end" for the end condition.
c) In Query data node, select the "XXX (Service Ticket)" form as the query object, setting the data filter to "Is the issue resolved" equal to the fixed value "No," and choosing "Multiple data" as the return type.
d) For the message reminder node, select "Query Data (N3)" as the sending node, choose the recipient from the handler's directory picker, select "To-Do" as the notification method, and configure the fixed message content: "There are unprocessed service tickets, please handle them promptly." After completing the configuration, click "Publish."
