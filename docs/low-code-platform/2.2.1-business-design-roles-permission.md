> **Note**: The business design module currently relies on the Low-Code platform. To use it, users must configure the Low-Code platform's permissions. Additionally, using DingTalk documents requires configuring permissions for DingTalk accounts that are synchronized with the system.  
> Roles without business design permissions cannot access the entire business design module.

The following are the reference configurations for other role permissions:

- **A.** To view DingTalk documents:  
  `Business Design_Default Permission` + `Business Design_Management Console`
  
- **B.** To create DingTalk documents:  
  `Business Design_Default Permission` + `Business Design_Management Console` + `Business Design_Create DingTalk Documents`

- **C.** To designate personnel for viewing/maintaining architecture design data:  
  `Business Design_Default Permission` + `Business Design_Management Console` +  
  `Specific Architecture Data_Viewer` *(view only)* /  
  `Specific Architecture Data_Maintainer` *(edit and other operations)*

- **D.** To view all architecture design personnel:  
  `Business Design_Default Permission` + `Business Design_Management Console` + `Business Design_View Architecture Design`

- **E.** For new architectural design personnel:  
  `Business Design_Default Permission` + `Business Design_Management Console` + `Business Design_New Architecture Design`

- **F.** To maintain all architecture design data personnel:  
  `Business Design_Default Permission` + `Business Design_Management Console` + `Business Design_Maintain Architecture Design`
