## 2.8 Application Monitoring

App monitoring primarily displays multi-dimensional statistical analysis data of published applications in the Low-Code platform. App analytics includes statistical results for six dimensions: visitor count, creation count, update count, deletion count, view count, and query count. App runtime distribution includes statistics for published applications, draft applications, to be published applications, and disabled applications. App data growth includes statistics for application access volume and form data growth. Time consumption includes the top 10 forms with the longest viewing time and the top 10 forms with the longest creation time.

Access the Low-Code platform from DEV. The app analytics section displays analysis data on visitor count, creation count, update count, deletion count, view count, and query count. Users can toggle between all applications and a single application.

- **Visitor count**: The number of people who view documents, query lists, or visit the application homepage. Multiple visits or queries by the same person are not counted repeatedly.
- **Creation count**: Form data created via the "Create" button, create interface, or action flow.
- **Update count**: Form data updated via the "Edit" button, update interface, or action flow.  
- **Deletion count**: Form data deleted via the "Delete" button, delete interface, or action flow.  
- **View count**: The total number of times form data has been viewed.
- **Query count**: the total number of times form data has been queried.
