### 2.7.1 Running Status

After enabling multiple services, a menu is displayed. The running status list mainly shows the running status of all applications in the system, including the running services to which the application belongs and the current status of the application. Users can enable, disable, or perform app migration for individual applications.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/Running Status.png" alt="Running Status" width="800" />
</div>
