### 2.13.1 Field Library

The data sources for the field library are divided into two types: system-preset and custom. System preset fields are automatically read by the program from mechanism fields and initialization fields, and cannot be deleted. Custom fields are defined by users in form design with related properties and saved to the field library. The field library uses the field code as the unique identifier.

In form design, the "Save to Field Library" operation allows users to store widgets and related properties—such as widget descriptions, prompt, and tracking marks—in the field library.

After form widgets are saved to the field library, they can be viewed in "Low-Code platform -> Business Term -> Field library". All fields can be disabled or enabled. Preset fields cannot be deleted, while custom fields can be deleted if not referenced by the terminology. Once referenced, they cannot be deleted.
