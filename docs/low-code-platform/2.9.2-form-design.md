## 2.9.2 Form Design

For business personnel who prefer a more intuitive understanding of form implementation results, the WYSIWYG form design option can be used for form configuration.

The form design interface consists of four sections, as shown in the diagram below. The left panel is the widget selection area. Users can drag & drop widgets to the form design area in the center, set widget properties in the right-side property settings panel, and perform form design operations using the toolbar above. After setting all widgets, save to complete the form design.

### 2.9.2.1 Data Model

Business forms consist of multiple sections such as data model, form design, process design, and data list view, allowing users to operate based on specific needs. For developers who prefer using data tables, the Low-Code platform offers a form design approach through data model design. The data model consists of data tables and fields, serving as the foundation for forms.

There are two ways to add fields and tables in a data model:
1. Adding data tables and fields through the data model
2. Generating fields and data tables by dragging widgets during form design

This chapter primarily explains how to add data tables and table fields in a data model.

#### 2.9.2.1.1 Add Data Table to the Main Table
## 2.9.2.1.1.1 Add Fields

For creating forms, fields can be quickly added in batches through the data model, then directly imported by selecting the layout on the form design page. After the form is created, the system automatically generates a data table and also supports adding fields directly to the table.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/add Fields1.png" alt="Add Fields Interface" width="800" />
</div>

### Create a form and add fields:
a) Open the data model page and click "Add Field";
b) Mainly involves filling in the field name, field editing (system defaults can be used directly), and selecting widget types;
c) After completing the fields, click on "Form Design" and select an appropriate layout to finalize the form. Specific rules and properties can be adjusted in the property area.

### Adding fields to existing data tables:
For example, adding a "Type" field to this attempt app. The procedure is as follows:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/add fields2.png" alt="Add Fields to Existing Table" width="800" />
</div>

*Figure 2.9–1 Add Fields to Existing Table*

a) On the data model page, click "Add Field," input the field name and field code, select the widget type, then click Save.
b) Open the form design page, add layout widgets, then open the data items, drag the type to the newly added layout widgets, then edit the dropdown single selection options (for specific operations, refer to 2.9.2.8.1.3 the Single Selection section).

## 2.9.2.1.1.2 Field Status

- **Inactive**: After a field is added, it defaults to the "inactive" status, meaning the field has not been generated in the database. It supports modifying the name, code, widget type, and deletion operations.
- **Active**: After clicking "Publish" in form design, the "Inactive" field changes to the "Active" status. Active fields do not support modifying the code or widget type; only the name can be modified.
- **Disabled**: Fields in the "Active" status have been generated in the database and may contain data, so they cannot be deleted. If a field is no longer in use, users can click "Disable." Disabled fields will still appear in the data model list and can be re-enabled.

### Field enable and disable operations:
Example: disabling and enabling the "Attempt" title in the attempt application form.

a) Disable field: Click "Disable" in operation, then click "Save";
b) Viewing and enabling fields: Click the filter button under "Status," check "Disabled" to view disabled fields; find the field to be enabled and click "Active," then click "Save" in the upper right corner.

## 2.9.2.1.1.3 Other Field Properties

- **Associated table**: Field data retrieved by associating existing tables through third-party data sources;
- **Index**: Whether an index is created for this field in the database, it is defaultly as unchecked.

## 2.9.2.1.2 Add Detail Table to the Data Model

A data table is generated by default after form creation. When a detail table is needed to store business data, a new detail table can be created, such as adding an "XXX Detail Table" for the applications. The Instructions are as follows:

- In the data model tab, click "Add Table." In the New Table window, input the name and table name. The table name can be auto-filled or manually input as a code starting with "mk_".
- Refer 2.9.2.1.1.1 to "Add Field" to add the corresponding fields for the detail table, then click save;
- Open the form design page, add layout widgets, then locate the detail table created in the previous steps from the data items. Drag the detail table header directly into the layout and adjust the field properties according to business requirements.

## 2.9.2.1.3 Add Sub table to Data Table

Sub tables primarily serve to display large forms by business segments, storing different business data in separate database tables to enable more complex business scenarios.

**Add Sub Table**: On the Data Model tab, click "Add Table," select "Sub table" as the type, input form name (required). The table name can be auto-filled or manually input with a code starting with "mk_." Click confirm to generate a sub table. Multiple sub tables can be added. The method for adding fields to sub tables is the same as for the main table.

*Note*: Sub table fields can only be added in the data model. After adding, switch to form design, drag fields from the sub-table data items in the left widget area into the form design, then configure the widgets the same way as for main tables.

## 2.9.2.1.4 Relationship between Data Model and Form

Once data model fields are created, they will automatically appear in the form design and can be dragged to generate widgets.

### Impact of data model operations on form design:

| Data Model Operations | Form Design |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Add Fields | Synchronously Displayed in the Data Items of the Form Design |
| Disabled Fields | Synchronously delete widgets in form design and disable data items |
| Delete Fields | Synchronously delete widgets and data items in form design |

### Impact of form design operations on the data model:

| Form Design Operations | Form Design | Data Model |
|------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Drag the Data Item to the Design Area | Generate Widget Element | No Effect |
| Disable Data Item | Data item disabled, widget removed | Synchronously Disable Data Item |
| Delete Data Item | Synchronously Delete Data Item and Widget | Synchronously Delete Data Item |
| Delete the Widget in the Design Area | The data item remains, but the widget is deleted. | The Data Item Still Exists |
| Publish Form | Form Available after Publishing | Activate All Inactive Data Items |

## 2.9.2.2 Widget Area

The widget area on the left side of the form design displays layout, widgets, and data items, primarily providing components for the design area. Widgets, layouts, and data items can all be dragged to the design area in the middle. Widgets are the display format of data, and the system includes various pre-built widgets for users to select.

**Design Approach**:
- Drag the layout to the center of the design area;
- Drag widgets (or data items) into the layout or directly drag widgets (or data items) to the design area;
- Set the relevant settings in the right-side property area.

### 2.9.2.2.1 Widget Group

For commonly used widget combinations, users can drap a group of single or multiple widgets into layout widget sets and add them to the widget group by "Widgets-> Layout Widgets", then drap & drop widgets into layout area, select the widgets and click "Set as a widget group". These widget sets can be reused in subsequent form designs, reducing repetitive configuration work.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/Widget Group.png" alt="Widget Group Interface" width="800" />
</div>

Widget groups are divided into two categories: public and private. Public widgets are primarily used to store commonly used widget sets for the team, which are accessible to everyone, such as overtime suite (overtime request forms) and leave suite (leave request forms). Private widgets are mainly used to store personal frequently used widget groups.

### 2.9.2.2.2 Data Items

The data items display main table fields, detail table fields, sub-detail table fields, and sub table fields (excluding layout widgets). The main table fields include system fields such as creator, create time, and create department. These system fields can be directly dragged into the form design for use based on business needs.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/Data Items.png" alt="Data Items Interface" width="800" />
</div>

The following operations can be performed on form fields in data items (excluding system fields):
- **Disable**: For active form fields, they can be disabled. Disabled fields will not appear in form design and will be unavailable across all system page.
- For inactive form fields, the ID can be modified, with the same effect as modifying the ID in the right-side properties panel.
- **Delete**: Inactive form fields can be deleted. Disabled fields will not appear in form design and will be unavailable across all system pages.

*Note*: The form fields and system fields in the "Data Item" can not all be dragged into the form designer for active using. The usable fields are in gray, while unused fields are in black.

## 2.9.2.3 Design Area

The design area is where the design is displayed. By dragging widgets and configuring widget styles, users can create the expecting form layout.

### 2.9.2.3.1 PC Design

Sequence of design form on PC: Design the layout first, then drag the widgets. For instance, to configure a product information recording form:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/PC Design1.png" alt="PC Design Interface" width="800" />
</div>

**Add layout widgets operation**: Drag and drop the "multi-row multi-col" layout widgets, set it to xxx rows and xxxx columns, then click confirm.

**Add Title**:
a) Drag the text description widget into the layout widgets users previously set up.
b) Set Content
c) Configure the title display style configuration.
d) Click to select a layout, then drag it to select other layouts, right-click and select the "Merge Cells" option.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/PC Design2.png" alt="PC Design Merge Cells" width="800" />
</div>

e) Select the layout widgets, right-click and choose the "Horizontally Center Alignment".

**Add Text Fields**:
a) Drag the single line text widget into the layout widgets.
b) Set the title content to "Name";
c) In the style settings, set the title to bold and configure the name to complete the configuration.
d) For other configurations, follow the steps above.

### 2.9.2.3.2 Mobile Design

The mobile version can directly synchronize with the PC version through "One click Import."

On mobile, one widget is displayed per row. No layout widgets need to be added; simply drag widgets or data items to complete the form design. It also supports deleting widgets and drag-and-drop sorting.

### 2.9.2.3.3 Multi-view

The form design area now supports multi-view functionality. Based on actual business needs, different scenario views can be created to associate various application scenarios with process nodes, meeting enterprises' diverse and complex business process approval requirements.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/Multi-view.png" alt="Multi-view Interface" width="800" />
</div>

**Form scenario view usage rules** (distinguishing between forms with and without processes):

- **Default View**: Used by default. During runtime, the new page, edit page, and view page all use the form's default view.
- **Create view**: After adding a new view, the new page in the form will always use the new view; otherwise, the default view is used.
- **Approval view**: For forms with processs, after adding an approval view to the form, the approver will use the approval view during runtime; otherwise, the default view will be used.
- **Publish view**: For forms with processes, after adding a publish view, the form will display the publish view when viewing completed data at runtime; otherwise, the default view is used.
- **Custom view**: In the manual selection scenario configuration within a process node, users can choose a custom view. During runtime, the approver will use the custom view, which has a higher priority than the default approval view.

**Scenario**: Using a company's internal visitor application approval process as an example, employees fill in visitor information, the receptionist reviews it, and security personnel verify the details. Different roles see distinct information during the approval process.

**Instructions**:
1. Add view to the visitor information table, containing visitor-related details and the information entered during the visit application.
2. Add a custom view (Receptionist Receptionist Approval View) to the visitor information table, containing visitor-related details and receive confirmation information that will be completed during the Receptionist approval process.
3. Add a custom view (Security Verification View) to the visitor information table, containing visitor-related details and host information for security personnel to review.
4. In the process design of the visitor information form, assign different form views to different approval nodes and publish the form.

## 2.9.2.4 Form Properties

Form properties primarily involve settings for form operation rules and homepage display. This section primarily covers form properties, including theme rules, form rules, data uniqueness, and view settings.

### 2.9.2.4.1 Theme Rules

Theme rules define the title rules for business data and apply globally to the current form. For example, approval titles and document titles will reference theme rules. Theme rules settings are set using the "Formula Editor" and are required fields, supporting up to 200 English characters.

**Theme rules naming method**: Using employee health information submission as an example, the desired outcome is "Sam's health information" Therefore, in the formula editor, reference the name variable + the string "Health information" (Note: String constants must be enclosed in English double quotes. For more details on rules, click "Rule Description" in the upper right corner of the formula editor page).

### 2.9.2.4.2 Form Rules

Diverse business scenarios are achieved through format validation, display rules, edit rules, required rules, and calculation rules of form widgets.

#### 2.9.2.4.2.1 Format Validation

Format validation primarily verifies the format of input content and prompts users to input the correct format based on predefined settings. The system defaults to showing format validation only for single line text settings. For example, verifying whether phone numbers, ID cards, email addresses, etc. are in the correct format.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/Format Validation.png" alt="Format Validation Interface" width="800" />
</div>

- Scenario: To validate whether a user has entered a correct phone number format in a form, this can be achieved by configure format rules.  
- Instructions: Select “Form property”-> “Form Rules”-> “Operation” to format validation.  
- The system includes several preset formats:  
  a) Email address: Validates whether the data is a valid email address.  
  b) URL address: Validates whether the data is a valid web URL.  
  c) Phone number: Validates whether the data is a valid mobile number.  
  d) Postal code: Validates whether the data is a valid postal code.  
  e) ID number: Validates whether the data is a valid ID number.  
  f) Minimum text length, maximum text length: Limits the length of input content. When configured with character count parameters, prompts can be retrieved through the parameters.  
  g) Regular expression: Validates whether the current input format is correct using a regular expression. For example, to restrict the date format to YYYY-MM-DD, configure the regular expression as: `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$`.  
  h) Customization: Implement by writing JavaScript code in the onValidator function.  

### 2.9.2.4.2.2 Display Rules

Set settings to widget the display and hiding of form widgets based on business scenario requirements. For example: When filling out a meeting RSVP form, if users are unable to attend the meeting, users must provide a reason for your absence; if users plan to attend as scheduled, no explanation is required.  

- Effect:  
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/Display Rules.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

- Configuration:  
  Step 1: Go to Form Properties → Form Rules → Display Rules, and click the " New rules ";  
  Step 2: Input the rule name—"XXX" set the settings and actions: If attending a meeting, hide the leave reason;  
  Step 3: Input the rule name—"XXX not requied" set the conditions and actions: If on leave, display the leave reason.  

- Conditional relationships:  
  a) Each rule can include multiple conditions or actions;  
  b) The "If condition node" can select either "AND" or "OR": Choosing "AND" requires all conditions to be met before executing the action; selecting "OR" means the action will be executed if any condition is met.  

- Widget Types and Corresponding Operators  

| Data Type                     | Operators                                        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Single-line Text             | Includes, excludes, =, !=, is empty, is not empty |
| Single-selection/Multiple-selection | Includes, excludes, =, !=, is empty, is not empty |
| Dropdown single select/Dropdown multi-select | Includes, excludes, =, !=, is empty, is not empty |
| Date/Numeric                 | &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, &lt;, !=, =, empty, not empty    |
| Organization Structure       | = , ! =, contains, does not contain, is empty, is not empty |

- Change Rule: Supports configuring "Show", "Hide", "Change Title Content".  
- Change object: Supports selecting fields from the main table or detail table. If a detail table field is selected in the condition, only fields from the current detail table can be selected in "Then Execute the Following Actions". During Homepage runtime, detail table data can only use the current row's data to control the display, hide, or required status of fields in the same row.  
- Other Notes:  
  a) This configuration has the lowest priority. If a field is configured as hidden in a process node, it cannot be displayed through this configuration. This rule only takes effect when the process node is configured to display the field.  
  b) Supports creating multiple rules. If the same field is set to show or hide multiple times, only the last configuration takes effect.  

### 2.9.2.4.2.3 Required Rules

Based on business scenario requirements, set conditions to widget whether form widgets are mandatory or optional. For example, when the total purchase price exceeds 100,000, the purchase description must be completed; if the total purchase price is less than or equal to 100,000, the purchase description is optional.  

- Effect:  
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/Required Rules.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

- Configuration:  
  Step 1: Go to Form Properties → Form Rules → “Required Rules”, and click the " New rules”.  
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/Configuration.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>  
  Step 2: Input the rule name—"XXX" set the conditions and actions: e.g., if the total purchase amount > 100,000, then the purchase description is required.  
  Step 3: Input the rule name—"XXX not requied" set conditions and actions: For example, if the total purchase amount is less than 100,000, then the purchase description is optional.  

- Widget Types and Corresponding Operators  

| Data Type                     | Operators                                        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Single-line Text             | Includes, excludes, =, !=, is empty, is not empty |
| Single-selection/Multiple-selection | Includes, excludes, =, !=, is empty, is not empty |
| Dropdown single select/Dropdown multi-select | Includes, excludes, =, !=, is empty, is not empty |
| Field          | Operators                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Date/Numeric   | &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, &lt;, !=, =, empty, not empty |
| Organization Structure       | =, !=, contains, does not contain, is empty, is not empty |

- Change rules: Supports configuring "required" and " not requied"; when selecting required, users can configure the required prompt.  
- Other Notes:  
  a) This configuration has the lowest priority, meaning that if a field is configured as required in a process node, it cannot be changed to “not required” through configuration here. This rule is only effective when the process node is configured as non-mandatory.  
  b) If the same field is set to “required” or “not required” multiple times, only the most recent configuration will take effect.  

### 2.9.2.4.2.4 Rules Modification

Configure form widgets to be read-only or editable based on business scenario requirements. For example, in the sales quotation process, if the total product price exceeds 100,000, the order discount rate field becomes editable; if it does not exceed 100,000, the order discount rate remains read-only.

- Effect:  
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/Rules Modification.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

- Configuration:  
  Step 1: Go to Form Properties > Form Rules > Modify Rules, and click “New rules”;  
  Step 2: Input the rule name—"XXX" set the conditions and actions: if the total product price exceeds 100,000, the whole order discount rate can be edited;  
  Step 3: Input the rule name—"YYY"—and set the conditions and actions: If the total product price is &lt;100,000, the entire order discount rate becomes read-only and cannot be edited.

- Widget Types and Corresponding Operators

| Data Type                     | Operators                                        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Single-line Text              | Includes, excludes, =, !=, is empty, is not empty |
| Single-selection/Multiple-selection | Includes, excludes, =, !=, is empty, is not empty |
| Dropdown single select/Dropdown multi-select | Includes, excludes, =, !=, is empty, is not empty |
| Date/Numeric                 | &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, &lt;, !=, =, empty, not empty |
| Organization Structure       | =, !=, contains, does not contain, is empty, is not empty |


- Change rules: Supports configuring "Read-only" or "Edit" modes.  

### 2.9.2.4.2.5 Calculation Rules

Set calculation rules for form widgets. Supported widgets mainly include calculation widgets, numerical, and currency widgets. The calculation result can only be selected as a calculation widget. For example: Total Purchase Amount = Purchase Quantity * Purchase Unit Price, where the Total Purchase Amount uses a calculation widget.  

- Configuration:  
  Step 1: Go to Form Properties → Form Rules → Calculation Rules, then click the "New Rule" button;  
  Step 2: Select the total purchase amount (must be a calculation widget type) as the calculation result;  
  Step 3: Set the formula: Select the mathematical product function for the formula; for values, choose variables from numerical or currency widgets within the form, separating multiple values with English commas.  

### 2.9.2.4.2.6 Privacy Rules

Set privacy rules in form settings. Multiple fields from main tables, detail tables, and sub-tables can be added to the privacy rules. Any fields involving business privacy can be configured within these rules. When users submit data on the new page, they will receive a pop-up reminder, and authorization records will be logged. For example, when submitting a project form involving monetary amounts, a pop-up will remind users about privacy-related fields and confirm whether to proceed with submission.  

- Configuration:  
  Step 1: Go to Form Properties → Form Rules → Privacy Rules, then click the New;  
  Step 2: Select form fields, then publish the form;  
  Note: The prompt and button schemes can be modified according to business needs.  
  After users submit data during runtime, authorization records can be viewed under "Low-Code platform → Form Management → Authorization."  
  https://demo.easycraft.ai/web/#/manage/sys-modeling/sysModelingForm/edit/1ivp64rlow57w1fd1wh8omfr4fpm5gvsj8w1/designer?appId=1io6u0dodw1fw8u8bwf3u68p2p9ksi11v6w1

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/Privacy Rules.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

### 2.9.2.4.3 Data Uniqueness

Used to determine the uniqueness of data records, the system validates based on the configured fields and alerts users if duplicate data is detected during creation. For example: Check if the product name is duplicated and prompt to modify if a duplicate is found.  

- Expected outcome: Check if the product name is duplicated.  
- Configuration:  
  Step 1: Go to Form Properties → Data Uniqueness, then click the Create;  
  Step 2: Input the rule name—"Product Names Must Be Unique";  
  Step 3: Set unique identifier data items (multiple selections allowed), define a period, and select a frequency (supported frequencies: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). Data cannot be duplicated within the period.  
  Step 4: Set prompt messages. When duplicate data is detected, the Homepage will display a pop-up with the configured message.  

### 2.9.2.4.4 Action Settings

Form action settings: Form properties now include pre-load and post-load events to meet business requirements before submission and after loading.  
On the right side of the form design, click "Add Action" to set the onBeforeSubmit event (before form submission) and onLoad event (after form loading). After adding, click "JS Edit" to open the JS panel, which will be positioned in the added event. The event will include a brief usage description. Edit the script as needed to achieve the event's purpose. For example: In a procurement scenario, the material code entered by the user must be validated before submission to verify its existence. If the code is invalid, submission will be blocked and an error message will be displayed to the user.  

### 2.9.2.4.5 Permissions Settings

Permissions are mainly used for form field configuration. The default permission is for everyone, and the status is enabled. Different permission groups can be added based on business scenarios, with varying usage permission settings for each.  

- For the finance center, the purchase request form only grants edit permission for the total amount. Configuration Method:  
  a) Set the permission name and authorize the organization as "XXX";  
  b) For new and edit views, check all fields for visibility permissions, and only check the "Total XXX Amount" field for editable permissions. Required fields do not need to be checked.  
  c) Check all field permissions for the view visibility settings.  
  d) Finally, click "Save."  

*Tip: If multiple enabled permission organizations take effect for the same organization, that organization will have all permissions from those organizations. For example, if Permission Organization A and Permission Organization B both apply to Organization a, and both are enabled, Organization a will have the permissions of both A and B.*  

### 2.9.2.5 Form Theme

The form theme allows for unified configuration of the form's theme, layout, common widgets, divider widgets, logo, and form name style, enabling users to complete designs more efficiently while maintaining consistent styling. The form themes include basic (default), simple, classic, block, and azure, which can be switched as needed.  

#### 2.9.2.5.1 Layout Settings

The form layout settings function is used to adjust the compactness or looseness of the form and can be selected as needed.  

#### 2.9.2.5.2 Generic Widget Settings

- PC Layout:  
  a) Left-right layout (title on the left side of the content). When configuring the left-right layout for PC, users can set the field title to align left or right.  
  b) Top-bottom layout (title above the content). When the title content is long, users can choose the top-bottom layout style.  

- Mobile Layout: The display style of mobile widget titles and content. The default is left-right layout. When configuring the left-right layout on mobile, users can set the field content to align left or right.  

#### 2.9.2.5.3 Divider Widget Settings

When a divider widget is used in a form, users can configure it uniformly through the "Divider Widget Settings" feature in the form theme to improve efficiency and maintain style consistency.

### 2.9.2.5.4 Display LOGO

- Upload Logo:  
  a) Logo upload options: Select from the media library or upload from your local device. The material library contains system-provided image resources. For local uploads, the accepted formats are limited to PNG, JPG, JPEG, and GIF, with a maximum file size of 100 KB. After the logo is displayed in the design area, users can adjust its size by modifying the height and width.  
  b) Logo Position: There are 6 options — top-left, bottom-left, top-right, bottom-right of the form, left of the title, or right of the title. Preview to see the logo effect.  
  c) Display on mobile: When checked, the logo will also appear on mobile. It is checked by default. The logo size can also be adjusted in the mobile design area.  

### 2.9.2.5.5 Display Form Name

When "display form name" is checked, the form name will automatically appear at the top of the form. Users can configure the style and alignment of the form name. The form name is displayed as the form name in the new view, while the title content is shown in the view mode.

To synchronize the current form's design style to other forms within the application, use the "Sync to Application" feature (this feature only applies to regular forms; category forms are not supported).

### 2.9.2.5.6 Background Settings

The default background of the form is white. Users can change the background color in the settings or add a background image to improve the visual appeal of the entire form page.

- Example Scenario:  
  The product requirement version displays various stages, with basic information shown in the form header and highlighted with a background.

- Instructions:  
  Steps: Under Form Design > Form Theme, locate the background settings. For solid colors, select the desired color (e.g., light blue), check the gradient option, adjust the height to the desired value (e.g., 400), publish the form, and view the result on the front end.

### 2.9.2.6 Widget Common Properties

Widget properties are primarily used to configure display and operational settings for widgets. This section introduces the common properties of widgets.

#### 2.9.2.6.1 Basic Settings

Basic settings primarily configure the widget type, title, description, ID, hint content, etc.

- Widget Type: By default, this is the currently used widget type. Some widgets can be switched to other widgets of the same type before they take effect:  
  a) Single line text, single selection, multiple selection, single-select dropdowns, and multi-select dropdowns can be switched between each other.  
  b) Numeric and currency widgets can be toggled;  
  c) Other widgets do not currently support switching.  

- Title: Serves as the title of the widget, a required field with a maximum of 200 characters. There is a "Hide Title" checkbox at the bottom. If selected, the title will be hidden and only the input field will be displayed.  

- Widget ID: Bound to the data item, with the same code as the data item. It can be modified in the properties before publishing but cannot be changed after publishing.  

- Widget Description: After entering content, a Tips icon will appear next to the widget name when displayed on the front end. Optional; display position and font style can be configured in settings.  

- Hint text: Pre-filled text that guides users on how to proceed when no content is entered. Optional field.  

#### 2.9.2.6.2 Property Settings

- Initial Value: sets the default initial settings. For example, set the initial value of the date widgets to the current time, or set the initial value of the directory picker widgets to the submitter.  
  a) Supported Widget Types: single line text, multi-line text, date widgets, numeric value, currency widgets, etc.  
  b) Recalculate on Update: After selecting the formula editor for the initial value, the recalculate configuration option appears by default unchecked. When this option is checked, during runtime, editing the main document will cause the field to recalculate its value based on the rules.  

- Passable Value: When enabled, the widget can still retrieve and assign values even if set to invisible.  

- Field Permissions: Supported widgets—single line text, multi-line text, date widgets, numeric value, currency widgets, etc.  
  a) Required field: Set whether this field is mandatory. To set conditions, users can configure them in Form Settings - Form Rules - Required Rules.  
  b) Editable: Set whether this field is editable. To set settings, users can configure them in Form Properties - Form Rules - Edit Rules.  
  c) Visibility: Set whether this field is visible. When visibility is disabled, the required and editable settings are automatically disabled, and both the current widget and its title are hidden. To set conditions for controlling a widget's visibility, users can configure them in Form Properties - Form Rules - Display Rules.  

- Audit Trail: When enabled, users can view the operation history of this widget. Supported widgets—single line text, multi-line text, date widgets, numeric value, currency widgets, etc.  

#### 2.9.2.6.3 Action Settings

Widget action settings mainly apply to individual widgets and support three action events: "onChange value change," "onFocus gain focus," and "onBlur lose focus." Click the JS icon for an action event to navigate to the corresponding event location and write the event code, or click the JS panel in the upper right corner to locate and write the corresponding event code.

- Example scenario: When filling out a purchase requisition form, to standardize the title format, action settings can be used to generate titles in a unified format.  

- Instructions:  
  Step 1: Select the purchased material name, click "onChange value changes" in the action settings, and name the action "Generate Title."  
  Step 2: Click "JS," edit the corresponding JS snippet on the JS page (recommended for users with development skills and the ability to troubleshoot issues), then click "OK" to complete the operation.  

#### 2.9.2.6.4 Style Settings

Configure the settings style of the form on the front end, including the widget title, widget content, and layout settings. The widget title and content can be customized with font color, bold, italic, and underline settings. Widget layout settings allow titles to be displayed left/right or top/bottom.

- Example Scenario: Bold the product name title, set the font color of the content to blue, and configure the layout as left-right. The steps are as follows:  
  1. Go to **settings**.  
  2. Select **layout settings**.  
  3. Choose **left-right layout**.  

#### 2.9.2.6.5 Margin Settings

Set the display margins of widgets on the front end, including top margin, bottom margin, left margin, and right margin in the settings. Widget margins can be customized in size. If a form theme is set and margin settings are later modified, the last customized margin settings will take precedence. Due to different layouts between the editing page and viewing page on mobile, there are separate margin settings for creation and viewing pages.  

### 2.9.2.7 Operation Area

The operation area manages common actions for form design, including undo, redo, save, publish, border design, etc.

- Undo and Redo:  
  a) Design actions can be undone and redone. However, once the form is saved, previous actions cannot be undone.  
  b) The undo/redo actions for the PC and mobile versions are not merged. Clicking undo on the PC can only undo PC operations, while the mobile design page can only undo mobile operations.  
  c) Undo actions in different views are independent; only actions in the current view can be undone at a time.  

- Merge - Merge cells: Used when selecting two or more layout cells. After merging, only the top-left widget remains; other widgets are deleted.  

- Split - Split cells: Select a single cell to use. The number of columns to split is automatically determined by the current layout.  

- Insert:  
  a) Insert row: Add a row above or below with the same number of columns as the current row.  
  b) Insert column: Add a column to the left or right with the same number of rows as the current column.  
  c) Delete row: Remove a row from the selected layout, including its widgets.  
  d) Delete column: Remove a column from the selected layout, including its widgets.  

- Delete: Perform delete operations on widgets.  

- Border: Add border styles, including weight and color.  
  a) Select the layout to adjust the cells or individual rows within it.  
  b) Widgets with one per row automatically have a one-row-one-column layout and also support border and background color modifications.  

- Line Style: settings for border line types.  

- Background Color: Select the layout settings and set the bottom color of the layout settings.  

- Alignment (right-click menu): Configure multiple cells in the layout widgets, primarily for displaying widgets within the layout: left, center, right, top, bottom, center. Default left-aligned and vertically centered.  

- Save: Save the pre-designed content of the form, requiring validation of the required fields in the form.  

- Publish: Publish form design and data fields. Only published forms can be used on the front end.  

- Preview: View the design effect of the current view. Preview does not save; it directly displays the current design content when previewing. The preview can be switched to view the PC and mobile versions.  

### 2.9.2.8 Widget Overview

This section primarily introduces the usage and application scenarios of widgets within forms. Widgets are mainly categorized into basic widgets, enhanced widgets, advanced widgets, layout widgets, and more.  

#### 2.9.2.8.1 Basic Widgets

This subsection introduces basic widgets. Basic widgets generate data item fields and are displayed synchronously in the data model.  

##### 2.9.2.8.1.1 Single-line Text

Single line text is the most basic field, widely used in forms to collect information such as text, numbers, and codes.

- Application Scenario:  
  a) Single line text can be used to input short text information, such as product names, company names, specifications, models, etc.  
  b) It can also be used to input numeric information that does not require or is unsuitable for arithmetic calculations, such as phone numbers, ID numbers, employee IDs, bank card numbers, and membership numbers.  

- Example Scenario: The personnel records used in HR management require employees' email addresses to be filled in. To minimize manual verification, the system needs to validate whether a valid address has been entered.  

- Expected outcome: If the input is not in the correct email address format, the system will automatically display an error message and prevent submission.  

- Instructions:  
  Step 1: Drag the single line text widget into the layout and set the title style.  
  Step 2: Click Form Rules > Format Validation, then select the edit option next to the email field and configure the validity check as "Email Address."  

- Other Configurations:  
  a) Configurable Prompt Text: Indicates the content the user needs to fill in.  
  b) Initial Value: the default initial value, which can be manually entered or defined by a formula. This is an optional field.  
  c) Length Limit: sets the character length limit for the input field, allowing only integers between 1 and 1000. The default is 200.  
  d) Encryption: When enabled, the widget content will be displayed in masked mode on the user side. Disabled by default.  
    i. Mask format: Offers five different format options, where '#' represents visible characters and '*' represents hidden characters. For example, selecting the format "**#" will display "**6" on the Homepage. Customizable formats.  
    ii. Encryption duration: Offers six options — "Permanent, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months."  
    iii. Expiration rule: Determines how encrypted content is displayed after the encryption period expires. Default is "Anonymization" (encrypted content displayed as "***"). Optionally "Clear" (delete the encrypted content).
