### 2.13.2 Terminology

A terminology is composed of fields from the field library. Users can combine fields from the field library that belong to similar business scenarios into one term, making it easier to quickly use in form designer. Users can create multiple terminology databases or delete them, depend on different business scenarios.

#### 2.13.2.1 Terminology Library Configuration

Users navigate to "Low-Code platform -> Business Term -> Terminology" and create a new terminology.

When creating a terminology library, users can selectively add enabled fields from the field library as needed, while also removing unnecessary fields (the same field in the field library can be referenced by multiple terminology libraries).

Users can edit, delete, disable, or enable terminology (changes to terminology and its fields will not affect form designs already created by the terminology, but will only impact future terminology and field selections in the form designer).

#### 2.13.2.2 Form terminology

In the form designer, users can select "Field Library" from the left panel to add the required terminology libraries to the form.
