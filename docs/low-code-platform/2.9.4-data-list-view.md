<img src="/img/Data Filtering.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

i. Set the data list view to display data that meets the filtering conditions. For example, to show only data for full-time employees, set the filter to display employees with a "full-time" status.

ii. **Custom Condition Calculation Method:**

- **Fixed Value:** Input a value according to the data type. For example, text type displays text, date type shows a date picker, and organizational structure displays an address book.

|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Single-line Text | =, !=, includes | Fixed value, input parameter, formula |
| Multi-line Text | =, !=, includes | Fixed Value |
| Single-selection/Multiple-selection | =, !=, includes | Fixed value, input parameter, formula |
