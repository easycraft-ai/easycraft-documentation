## 2.13 Business Terms

The business term feature enables administrators to create commonly used field types in the field library. When adding fields on the form design page, they can be directly dragged from the field library into the form designer, allowing administrators to quickly build forms.

The business term also has permission restrictions, enabling separate maintenance of the field library and terminology.
