Generic Templates facilitate the use of both Generic Form Templates and Generic Process Templates. Generic Form Templates are primarily designed for scenarios where multiple subsidiary companies share a common form but manage their respective processes independently. Generic Process Templates are useful when subsidiary companies need to maintain their own generic templates, such as in real estate, where a single form might be used across numerous process templates.
