For business users, who prefer an intuitive understanding of the form's implementation and favor a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) approach to form building, the assembled "Form Design" method provides an ideal configuration solution.

The Form Design interface consists of four main sections:

**a)** Left Panel (Widget Selection Area): Users can drag and drop widgets into the central Form Design Area.  
**b)** Central Form Design Area.  
**c)** Right Panel (Property Settings Area): Configure widget properties here.  
**d)** Top Section (Operation Buttons): Perform form design operations using the available buttons.  

Once all widgets are configured, simply click **Save** to complete the form design.  

For detailed form design operations, refer to **Section 2.2.3 "Form Design"** in the *Low-Code Platform Operation Manual*.

### Version Control of Form Design
After the form is published, version **1.0** is automatically generated. The version number and historical versions can be viewed in the toolbar at the top right of the Form Design page.  

Version management allows switching between and editing different versions of the form.  

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/version management entry.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

**To view historical versions:**  
- Click the version number dropdown and select **"All Versions"**.  
- A historical version list window will pop up, displaying all past versions.  

**To edit a historical version:**  
1. Click the **"Edit"** button next to the desired version.  
2. A form design template window for that version will open, allowing modifications.  

**Important Notes:**  
- Modifications to a historical version only affect historical process data that was created using that version.  
- Use this feature with caution, as it directly impacts the form fields of historical workflows.
