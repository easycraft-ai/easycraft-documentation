### 3.7.2 Process Node
Node types include: **Approval Nodes, CC Nodes, Signature Nodes, Voting Nodes, Robot Nodes, Subprocess Nodes, Embedded Subprocess Nodes, Flexible Subprocess Nodes, Auto-authority Subprocess Nodes, Conditional Branches, Manual Branches, Parallel Branches, Rule Block Subprocess Nodes, Signal Waiting Nodes, Dummy End Nodes**.  
These node types are designed to cover virtually all standard business use cases.  



#### 3.7.2.1 Common Node Properties
While each node has unique properties, they also share common settings.  

##### 3.7.2.1.1 Node Name
The Node Name is required. When a node is added to the canvas, it has a default name that can be modified for business needs.  

##### 3.7.2.1.1 Node Help
Node Help is an optional field used to provide notes about the current node.  

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/node properties.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>



##### 3.7.2.1.2 Data Permission
Data Permission sets the usage permissions of a node’s form fields.  
Click **Data Permission → Open Data Permission** to configure detailed read/edit/required settings for each field.  

For example: If the “Manager Approval” node is given **Editable** permission, managers can update fields like purchase amount and budget during approval.  

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data permission settings.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>



##### 3.7.2.1.3 Listener Configuration
Listeners monitor events at the process, node, and task levels (e.g., **Process Start, Node Entry, Task Submission**). They trigger actions such as **Business Methods, Context Variable Assignment, Process Task Expansion, and Broadcast Process Signal**.  

**Use Cases:**  
- Project management: Automatically generate a project record after approval.  
- License management: Update license status upon approval.  
- Task management: Update task status after confirmation.  

**Configuration Steps:**  
1. Go to the **Listener Config** tab and click **Add Listener**.  
2. Name the listener.  
3. Select the event type (e.g., **Handler Approval Event**).  
4. Choose **Business Methods** as the Execute Action.  
5. Select the corresponding Business Method.

### 3.7.2.2 Approval Node
The Approval Node is the most frequently used node type, mainly for setting approvers.  
Approvers can be selected from the organizational structure or defined via the formula editor.  

Supports:  
- Sequential approval  
- Joint review (all must approve)  
- Single approval (any approver can approve)  
- Skipping duplicate identities  

**Adding Approval Nodes:** Click on a node in the left panel or drag it onto the canvas.  



#### 3.7.2.2.1 Node Properties

**Basic Info**

**a) Default Handler**  
Ways to assign node handlers:  
- **Directory Picker**: Select personnel, positions, or groups from organizational structures.  
- **Formula Editor**: Dynamically determine approvers via simple mode, expressions, scripts, or advanced mode.  

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/assign default handler.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

*Figure 3.7–9 Assign Default Handler*

- Skip if the handler already approved earlier.  
- Do not skip duplicates (flows normally).  

**Form Selection**  
Nodes can be configured to display specific forms, either system-designed or third-party integrated forms.  
- **Scene Associated with the Form**: Default is auto-match; manual selection possible.

  <img src="/img/dynamic sup-process.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

**Figure 3.7–20 Dynamic Sup-process**

### Application Scenarios:
- **Departmental Joint Review**: In a departmental joint review scenario, each department conducts independent approvals, and their internal approval progress may vary. Users can drill down into the process diagram to view detailed flow information for each department.

### Prerequisites:
- A dynamic generic fragment must be configured and activated in **"Process Platform - Process Fragments."**
  - Within this fragment, the **"Leader Approval"** node needs to obtain the department leader of the joint review department.
  - The handler scope for this node is configured using the formula editor to retrieve the department leader of the dynamic organization.
  - The **"Dynamic Organization"** variable represents the specific department corresponding to the send object selected by the handler.

### Configuration Steps:
1. **Add Dynamic Sub-Process Node**:  
   Enter the process design interface, add a **"Dynamic Sub-Process Node"** to the canvas area, and configure its node properties.
   - **Organization Source**: Choose between "Previous Manual Node Designation" or "Default Organization."
   - **Organization Scope**:
     - Use Formula Editor: Define the organizational scope using the formula editor.
     - View Data Settings: Review the data settings for the scope.
   - **Default Organization**:
     - Use Formula Editor: Define the default organization using the formula editor.
     - View Data Settings: Review the data settings for the default organization.
2. **Initiate New Instance (Frontend)**:  
   The initiator creates a new process instance, fills in the **"Joint Review Department"** field on the form, and submits the instance.
3. **Select Send Objects**:  
   At the **"Document Processing"** node, the next step is to select the **"Department Joint Review"** node and choose the send objects (e.g., specific departments).
4. **View Instance Process Diagram**:  
   After submission, view the instance process diagram. Based on the N selected send objects, N independent process fragments will be dynamically generated.

### Benefits:
This functionality is highly applicable to approval scenarios in government and enterprise sectors, such as official document issuance and reception. When a single matter requires collaborative approval from multiple departments, each department processes internally and provides a final opinion. By integrating with the form's **"Approval"** control, opinion lists can be summarized and presented on the form according to custom layouts and data filtering requirements, aiding subsequent approvers in their decision-making.

---

### 3.7.2.19 Free Jump Node

The **Free Jump Node** allows for flexible transitions between nodes, making it suitable for scenarios where process flow requires manual decision-making, and approval steps are uncertain or involve multiple revisions.

Example: A company document might be received by a secretary, then signed by a leader, and then confirmed by the secretary again.

This node supports multiple incoming and outgoing connections without restrictions. During approval, the node handler can specify which single outgoing connection to follow and who will approve the next step. The selectable personnel/organizational scope can be restricted during the design phase.

### Node Property Description:
- **Default Handler**: When a non-free jump node flows into this node, the default handler is automatically identified.
- **Handler Scope**: When another free jump node flows into this node, one person from the jump scope's personnel set will be selected as the handler. Handlers can be chosen from the organizational structure, formula editor, or leader's secretary. For leader's secretary, specific groups can be configured; if no group is selected, all leader's secretaries will be set as the handler scope.
- **Next Step**: Configure the next selectable node(s) when flowing out of this node. It supports conditional matching for selectable nodes. If no condition is configured, the flow is visible by default. If a condition is configured, the flow can only be selected when the condition is met.

### Application Scenarios:
- **Company Document Flow**: A company document might be received by a secretary, then signed by a leader, and then confirmed by the secretary again, involving back-and-forth approvals.

### Configuration Steps:
1. **Add Free Jump Node**:  
   Enter the process design interface, add a **"Free Jump Node"** to the canvas area, and configure its node properties.
2. **Initiate New Instance (Frontend)**:  
   The initiator creates a new process instance and selects the send object(s), then submits the instance.
3. **View Instance**:  
   View the instance. The user will have the option to choose the next step for the process.
