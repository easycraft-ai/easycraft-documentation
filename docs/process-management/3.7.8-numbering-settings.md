The Numbering Settings feature is primarily used to design a unique identification code for each process instance, allowing differentiation between various process instances initiated from the same template. There are two methods for configuring numbering rules:

- **Reference Existing Numbering Rules**: This method allows you to retrieve and apply predefined numbering rules that are already set up within the system. *(Tip: System preset numbering rules can typically be found under: System Management > Mechanism Management > Numbering Mechanism.)*
- **Custom Numbering Rules**: Custom numbering rules provide the flexibility for users to define their own rules for generating numbers based on specific business scenarios. This feature supports five types of numbering elements: Date, Time, Serial Number, Constant, and Custom. Additionally, you can preview the generated number in real-time using the "Simulate Numbering" function.
  - **Number Generation Time**:
    - Generate After Submission: The numbering information is generated after the process is submitted for approval.
    - Generate Upon Page Opens: The numbering information is generated immediately when the process initiation page is opened.
  - **Description**: Provides an area to add explanatory notes or remarks for the numbering rule.
