  - Quick actions for Urge and Cancel Tracking are available.
  - Processes can be tracked from the " Completed" list or from within a process instance itself.
  a)	Track Whole Process: Equivalent to tracking all nodes and being notified upon process completion or abandonion.
  b)	Track Specific Nodes: Choose specific Drafting Nodes, Approval Nodes, Signature Nodes, or Voting Nodes to track. You can also opt to be notified when the process is completed or abandoned. When a tracked node is actioned (e.g., Jacky submits and approves instance A with the comment "Agree"), the tracker receives a notification: "[Process Tracking Update] Instance A: Jacky - Approve "Agree."
