Data Permissions provide a unified authorization framework for Process Management data. This framework controls the permissions users have on the frontend to view, edit, and delete process instance data. Permissions can be granted using the following methods:

- **Authorize by Org**: Permissions can be granted by selecting specific personnel, positions, groups, departments, and institutions.
- **Authorize by Process Template Scope**: If left empty, all active templates will be authorized.
- **Authorize by Category Scope**: You can select categories for which the user has maintenance or usage permissions.
- **Data Scope Authorization**:
  - All: All non-draft instance data within the authorized scope is visible.
  - Self Only: Only data where the current user is the owner is visible.
  - Own Institution: Data belonging to the user's institution is visible.
  - Own Department: Data belonging to the user's department is visible.
  - Customization: Data can be filtered based on specified conditions.
- **Operation Permission Authorization**: Includes permissions for viewing forms, editing forms, deleting forms, intervening in processes, and downloading all attachments.
