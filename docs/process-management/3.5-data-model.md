The design of data fields serves as the foundation for form design. When users are designing fields for the main table, detail tables, and sub-tables, there are primarily two methods for adding fields:  

**a)** Adding data tables and fields within the data model  
**b)** Dragging widgets in the form design interface to generate fields and corresponding data tables  

When creating a new process template, after filling in the basic information, the system automatically navigates to the form design page. Users can then click the "Data Model" tab at the top to switch to the data model interface.  

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data model.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>
