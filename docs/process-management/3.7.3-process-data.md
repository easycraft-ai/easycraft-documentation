### 3.7.3 Process Data

The **Process Engine** integrates with third-party systems to enable data flow across multiple forms and systems, ultimately implementing end-to-end process integration. If the MK process engine attaches with forms built in the system, then we can see those data fields in **“Designed Forms.”**

But when connecting with third-party systems, the MK process engine does not provide corresponding forms nor store data, so all business data required for process execution is retrieved in real time from third-party systems. Therefore, during the design of the process template, we must configure data field mappings between the process template and third-party system APIs during template creation. These mappings enable automatic data retrieval from connected systems during process execution.

### 3.7.3.1 Process Variables

**Process Variables** are dynamic data containers used within workflow automation systems to capture, store, and transfer context-specific information throughout a process instance. They act as the "memory" of a workflow, enabling:

</div>
- **Contextual Decision-Making**: Execute logic based on real-time process data (e.g., `_ProcessStatus = "Rejected"` → trigger a notification).
- **Audit Trails**: Record critical metadata (e.g., who initiated the process, when, and under what title).
- **Cross-System Integration**: Pass data between systems (e.g., sync `_ProcessCreator` details to CRM).
- **User Interface Customization**: Dynamically render forms or approvals using variable values.

**Figure 3.7–15 Context Variable in Process Data**

### Key Characteristics:
- **Temporary**: Exists only during the process runtime and is cleared after completion.
- **Dynamic**: Can be updated in real-time based on external inputs or intermediate calculations.
- **Cross-System Compatibility**: Enables data exchange between external systems and the process engine when direct integration is restricted.



### Common Use Cases & Examples:

#### 1. Bridging External Data to a Process Form

**Scenario**:  
Your process needs to use a field value from an external database (e.g., a customer’s ID from Salesforce), but the target form in your system cannot directly read from Salesforce.

**Solution**:
1. Fetch the customer ID from Salesforce via an API.
2. Store it in a Context Variable (e.g., `customerID_from_Salesforce`).
3. Pass this variable to the process form for further processing (e.g., auto-populating a field).

**Why?**  
The Context Variable acts as a temporary "holding area" to circumvent direct integration limitations.



#### 2. Dynamic Branching Based on External Conditions

**Scenario**:  
A process must decide whether to approve a request based on a field value (e.g., "Risk Score") from an external risk assessment tool, but the process engine cannot query this tool directly during runtime.

**Solution**:
1. Retrieve the "Risk Score" from the external tool beforehand.
2. Store it in a Context Variable (e.g., `RiskScore`).
3. Use this variable in a conditional branch (e.g., "If RiskScore > 70, route to manager approval").

**Why?**  
The Context Variable decouples the process from external system dependencies during execution.



#### 3. Staging Data for Multi-Step Processes

**Scenario**:  
A process involves multiple teams (e.g., Legal + Finance), and each team adds data (e.g., contract terms, budget approvals) in different forms that must be consolidated before final submission.

**Solution**:
1. Store each team’s input in separate Context Variables (e.g., `legalTerms`, `financeApproval`).
2. Aggregate these variables into a final form for a consolidated document or database entry.

**Why?**  
Context Variables ensure data consistency and availability across non-sequential steps.
