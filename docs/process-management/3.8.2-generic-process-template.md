*Figure 3.8â€“5 Creating a Generic Process Template*

**Create Generic Process Template**: When creating a new Generic Process Template, only the Process Design tab is displayed. This tab allows you to draw the process diagram and configure its properties.

**Reference Generic Process Template**: The Process Design initially defaults to a custom mode. You can switch to "Template Utilization Mode," and this switch is supported even after the template has been published. Upon attempting to reference a template, a confirmation prompt will appear. If you confirm, any existing custom content within the process will be cleared.

After referencing a Generic Process Template, the process nodes become view-only, meaning they cannot be edited or deleted.
