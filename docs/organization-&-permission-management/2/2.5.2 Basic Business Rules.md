 ### 2.5.2 Basic Business Rules

- The basic organizational elements are the same as the original (administrative) organizational structure, including organizations, sub-organizations, personnel, and positions.
- **Organizations, sub-organizations**: New (multi-dimensional) organizations/sub-organizations can be created in a multi-dimensional organization.
- **Personnel**: New (multi-dimensional class) personnel cannot be created in a multi-dimensional organization; they can only be referenced from the (administrative) organizational structure.
- **Position**: Positions are not distinguished by organizational dimensions, multi-dimensional organizations can also use positions; However, personnel in multi-dimensional organizations do not have a "primary position" (the "primary position" in personnel information is removed).

- A multi-dimensional organization can include (administrative) organizational structure nodes and multi-dimensional organization nodes, but nesting is not allowed.
- Multi-dimensional organization nodes cannot reference a node from another multi-dimensional organization.
- An (administrative) organizational structure node can be referenced by different multi-dimensional organizations or by multiple nodes within the same multi-dimensional organization, but nesting is not allowed.
- When an institution or department within an (administrative) organizational structure node is referenced, its subordinate organizational elements are automatically synchronized. In the referencing multi-dimensional organization, no creations, deletions, or modifications are allowed (No modifications of basic info, only permission-related info such as administrators, readers, visibility permissions, etc.). (And the referenced organizational structure node can no longer be maintained).
- Multi-dimensional organizations do not have visibility permissions; Visibility permissions are settled in administrative organizations and "Special Visibility Settings."
- **Special Visibility Settings**:
  - Only administrative organization personnel can be selected for visibility settings.
  - The visibility selection scope includes administrative organizations and multi-dimensional organizations.
