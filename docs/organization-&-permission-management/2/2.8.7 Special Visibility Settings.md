### 2.8.7 Special Visibility Settings

**[Function Overview]**

Specify institutions (Institutions/departments) or personnel with special visibility.

"Set special visibility for institution/department" means: Defining what special visibility permissions personnel under that unit will have (including what they can access and what is restricted). This essentially functions as a batch visibility configuration for personnel.

Important Note: Personnel visibility is not determined by a single special visibility configuration. It must consider the visibility settings of both the personnel and their department, as well as the inheritance of department visibility and institution isolation.

**[Detailed Functions Note]**

1. **Personnel**: Set specific visibility for a person.
   - **Personnel Name**: Automatically displays the main institution/department and primary position after selection from the directory picker.
   - **Visible to**: Can be left empty. But the visible range cannot be empty while it's "Hide". If left empty, then it means all personnel, institutions, departments, positions, and groups are visible.
   - **"Whether to hide"**: Closed by default, but the visible range cannot be empty while "Hide" cannot be set as "No"
   - **Hide from All Personnel and Departments (To hide from all and department)**: Meaning this personnel is not visible to any personnel or departments.
   - **Visible to specific Personnel/Departments**: Only designated personnel and departments can view this personnel.

2. **Institution/Department**: Set special visibility for an institution or department.
   - **Institution/Department**: Automatically displays the institution/department and organizational category when selected from the directory picker.
   - **Visible Organizations/Personnel**: Required, cannot left empty. Specify the visible organizations or personnel.
   - **Data Visibility Permission**: There are 3 options.
   - **Self only**: Can only view one's own data; Cannot view that of subordinates, peers, and others at the same level.
   - **Same Level and Subordinates of the Organization**: Can view data of current level and all subordinate levels.
   - **Specified Organizations/Personnel**: Designate visible and invisible data of organizations/personnel.
   - **"Whether to hide"**: Closed by default, but the visible range cannot be left empty while "Hide" is set as "No"
   - **Hide from All Personnel and Departments**: All personnel and departments cannot view this institution/department.
   - **Visible to specific Personnel/Departments**: Only designated personnel and departments can view this institution/department.

3. **Visibility Group**: Set the visible range for multiple personnel

"Visibility Group" means that personnel may have individual visibility, or multiple personnel may share visibility of the same institution/department. This type is categorized into a group. When personnel have both individual visibility and belong to a visibility group, the visibility group's scope takes priority.
