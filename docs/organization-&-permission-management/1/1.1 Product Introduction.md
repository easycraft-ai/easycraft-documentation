 ## 1.1 Product Introduction

Traditional enterprise organizations typically refer to internal departmental level relationships and their personnel. The IT management system is required to create, modify, delete, copy, move and manage the permissions of an organization, enabling these organizations and related personnel to participate in business collaboration.

Administrative organizations have expanded the original scope of traditional organization structures by incorporating the entire supply chain and relevant external entities (organizations or individuals) involved in end-to-end business collaboration. The IT management system not only supports traditional management functions but also provides new capabilities such as quick onboarding via scanning QR code to add personnel or join in group.

The core objectives for establishing the administrative organization are to unify manage all business-related internal and external entities, enhance the efficiency and operational quality of end-to-end business processes through collaborations.

Although this platform is capable of operating separately as an organizational services provider, it frequently integrates with business systems to deliver services calls, such as directory picker.
