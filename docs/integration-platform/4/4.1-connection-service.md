## 4.1 Connection Service

Users need to know which service environment the interface belongs to before registering one. Therefore, the prerequisite for registering an interface is to create a connection service. Creating a connection service involves setting up environment configurations. Extract the environment configuration tasks prior to the registration interface and convert them into reusable services.

The integration platform provides the creation of connection services for three different protocols: SOAP, JDBC, and REST, and supports interface registration for these protocols.
