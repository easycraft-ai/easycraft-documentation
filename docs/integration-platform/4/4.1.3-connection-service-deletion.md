### 4.1.3 Connection Service Deletion

If the current connection service is abandoned or no longer needed for business purposes, creator can delete the information to avoid interference.

To prevent misoperations, the connection service must be set as "Disabled" before deletion. Only disabled connection services can be deleted. Please note that when deleting a connection service, all associated interface information under that service will also be cleared. Therefore, please verify whether the interfaces under the current connection are no longer in use before deletion.

Deletion supports both single and batch deletion.
