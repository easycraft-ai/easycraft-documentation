### 4.2.3 Interface Declaration Deletion

If the current interface is abandoned or no longer needed for business purposes, it can be deactivated or deleted to avoid interference.

To prevent misoperations, the registered interface status must be set as "Disabled" before deletion. Only disabled interfaces can be deleted. Deletion supports both single and batch deletion.
