## 6.1 Event Definition

Event Definition mainly manages events broadcast by external systems. For example, if the SAP system publishes an event or interface called "Create Data", the integration platform registers this event or interface then provides the corresponding Open API for SAP system to use. When the SAP system creates data, the integration platform can listen for it, thereby triggering subsequent execution actions to link business scenarios between systems.
