## 6.2 Built-in Events

Built-in Events mainly manage events broadcast by internal system. For example, if a low-code platform publishes an event/interface called "Create Data", it can register this event/interface with the integration platform's built-in events by implementing the platform's extension points. Once the low-code platform creates data, the integration platform can listen for this action, thereby triggering subsequent execution steps to link business scenarios between the low-code platform and external systems.

1. The built-in event list displays the following fields: event name, event identification, system, remarks, status, and operations.
2. The only operations available for built-in events are "Enable/Disable"; deletion is not allowed.
3. Built-in events can only be registered through extension points; manual creation is not allowed.
4. The system to which a built-in event belongs is fixed and is not part of the integration platform.
