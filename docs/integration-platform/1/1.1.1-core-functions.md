### 1.1.1 Implementation Plan

The integration platform serves as a bridge connecting the MK platform system with external ones. It supports integration with third-party systems through various mainstream integration technologies, including SOAP, JDBC, REST interfaces, message push, and service conversion.

The integration service layer also offers various methods for quick integration with external systems, such as API gateway management, account management, authorization management, and business orchestration. Among which, business orchestration is an self-innovated integration scenario engine. Through this engine, users can quickly develop a set of integrated tools for a particular field on the basis of general integrated functions. Thus, to facilitate rapid cross-system business process flows and reduce the complexity and workload of integration development.
