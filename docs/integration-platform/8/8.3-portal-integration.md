## 8.3 Portal Integration

Portal Integration is designed to enable data integration between the MK Platform's portal management and third-party systems through an integration platform. When components data source displayed on the portal come from a third-party system, users can quickly connect to the third-party data source by registering an interface via the integration platform and then display it on the portal.

The core function of portal integration is to reduce the development workload required for integrating with third-party systems. All integration requirements are fulfilled through interface configuration. It enables more flexible access, simpler configuration, and optimal results.
