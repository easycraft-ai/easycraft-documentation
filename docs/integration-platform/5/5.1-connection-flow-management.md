## 5.1 Connection Flow Management

The connection flow management module is mainly about managing and maintaining various types of connection flows. Currently, the system provides three types of connection flows: scheduled task, listener event, and manual trigger. Scheduled tasks execute connection flow tasks by setting the timer. Listener event triggers connection flow tasks by listening for specific events, and manual triggers require users to manually execute connection flow tasks. The connection flow management list provides two tabs for managing connection flows: the connection flow list and the system execution event list.

**Connection Flow List**: The operations include querying, filtering by category, and creating.

**System Execution Event List**: Records scheduled task data from the connection flow. The operations include querying and editing.
