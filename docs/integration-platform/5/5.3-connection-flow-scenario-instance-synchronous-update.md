## 5.3 Connection Flow Scenario Instance - Synchronous Update

**Scenario 1**: Customer A utilizes the Tritium Cloud system and has subsequently acquired the MK low-code platform. They need to transfer sales orders entered in the Tritium Cloud system to the sales orders in the low-code platform, updating order information through scheduled tasks.

**Configuration Process:**

First, ensure that the required interfaces for the connection flow configuration are accessible. This scenario requires the following interfaces: the Tritium Cloud system sales order retrieval interface and the low-code form writing interface.

Create a scheduled task connection flow: Go to Business Orchestration> Connection Flow Management, click the "New" button in the upper-right corner, and a new connection flow window will open. Select "Scheduled Task" as the type, then edit the name, code, and status information before saving.

After confirming the creation, proceed to the connection flow design interface:

Add a scheduled task start node and set the trigger time (e.g., daily at 6 AM) to activate the connection flow.

After completing the start node setup, add an execution node below the start node, and select the interface action: "Get Tritium Cloud / Fetch Form Information".

Set parameter mapping to assign values to the interface's input parameters.

After the execution node retrieves the Tritium Cloud sales form data, add another node and select the action: "Create Document - Low-Code Platform Form."

Set field mappings to assign the output result object of the Tritium Cloud form data to the input parameter fields of the low-code platform form.

After completing the write node settings, proceed to the end node configuration to set up the output result fields and their mapping relationships.
