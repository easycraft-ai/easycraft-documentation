### 3.1.3 System Deletion

If there is an error in added system or integration is not currently needed, users can manually delete the system.

To avoid misoperations, the system status must be set to "Disabled" before deletion. Only disabled systems can be deleted. After deletion, the connection services created and the interfaces registered under the current system will also be deleted, and the API gateway policy information provided for the current system will be cleared. (Deleting a system is a high-risk operation. Please confirm whether the deletion is necessary.)
