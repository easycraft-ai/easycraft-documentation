## 7.3 Authorization Management

Authorization Mgt mainly involves unified permission maintenance for API interface access. Authorization is supported through two modes: account-based and client IP-based authorization for APIs. In Authorization Mgt, users can query the registered authorization policies for API interfaces, maintain this information, and add new authorization policies as needed.

The authorization management list supports filtering and sorting.
