## 7.4 Flow Limiting Management

Flow Limiting Mgt mainly controls the flow limits for the system's exposed API interfaces. There are two limiting modes: account-based and client IP-based.

Since flow limiting mainly targets accounts and client IPs that can access the interfaces, access authorization (for accounts and client IPs) must first be completed for a specific interface before configuring flow limits.

**Flow Limiting Description:**
1. Disabled by default, meaning no flow limiting restrictions are applied to any interface.
2. The flow limits set on this page are global. There are two dimensions for flow limiting: account and client IP. In global flow limiting, both account and client IP flow limits can be disabled or enabled simultaneously. When both are enabled, flow limits will apply to all authorized accounts and client IPs globally.
3. After enabling the flow limiting policy, users can set limits per second, per minute, and/or per hour. Leaving the field blank means no limit is applied.
4. **Flow Limiting Rule**: Interface flow limiting > Default flow limiting. If users set custom flow limiting rules for a single interface, the interface flow limiting conditions take precedence, overriding the global flow limiting rules.
