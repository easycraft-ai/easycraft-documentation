## 7.1 API Services

API services mainly record interfaces registered on the MK Platform. In API Services, users can query information of registered interfaces on the whole MK Platform and enable or disable these interfaces.

**Enable Service**: Once enabled, other systems will be able to access the interface. For disabled interface in the list, simply click "   " to enable:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/API Services.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

Batch enabling is supported—select all the interfaces to be enabled and click "Enable Services" button in the upper-right corner:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/API Services1.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

**Disable Services**: Once disabled, other systems will not be able to access this interface. For enabled interface in the list, simply click the icon on the right to disable:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/API Services2.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

Batch disabling is supported—select all interfaces to be disabled and click "Disable Services" button in the upper-right corner:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/API Services3.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

Since other systems will no longer be able to access the disabled interfaces, please perform this operation with caution.

**API Service List**: Supports filtering and sorting, allowing users to filter by API service classifications and other fields, with options to set the order as either ascending or descending.
