1. **API Gateway Statistics**: Includes the total number of Open APIs and the activation rate.
   - (1) Total Open APIs: The total number of Open APIs within a specified time period, including both enabled and disabled ones. Statistic data are updated in real-time when OpenAPIs are added, enabled, disabled, or deleted.
   - (2) OpenAPI Activation Rate: The activation number/total number of Open APIs within a specified time period. Statistic data are updated in real-time when interfaces are added, enabled, disabled, or deleted.

2. **Statistics of Open API Call Volume**: Includes call volume and call anomaly counts. Supports filtering queries by this week, this month, and this year.

Statistic Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also manually refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.
   - (2) Call Success Rate: The number of successful calls/the total number of calls of Open API.

3. **Interfaces Distribution**: Counts the total number of Open APIs of each business application, ranking from highest to lowest. If there are too many business applications, only the top 10 will be statisticized, the rest will be grouped under "Others". Data are refreshed when Open APIs are added, enabled, disabled, or deleted. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also refresh manually by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.

Supports filtering queries by today, the last 7 days, and the last 30 days. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.

5. **Statistics of Open API Runtime Count**: Counts the proportion of Open API runtime status within a specified time period. Supports viewing runtime percentages for today, yesterday, and this week. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.

6. **Statistics of Authorized Account Call Count**: Counts the number of Open API calls made by all authorized accounts within a specified time period.

7. **TOP10 Failed Open API Call**: Counts the top 10 Open API failed calls within a specified time period. Counts the current day by default. Supports viewing for today, yesterday, and this week. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.

8. **Open API Calls Average Duration Ranking**: Counts the average duration of Open API calls within a specified time period. Counts the current day by default. Supports viewing for today, yesterday, and this week. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can manually refresh the data by clicking the button in the upper-right corner.
