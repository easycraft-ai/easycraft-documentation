## 2.1 Interface Monitoring

Provides real-time monitoring of the quantity, distribution, call, operation, call duration, and cache hit rates of third-party interfaces of the whole MK platform in the form of chart statistics.

**Notes:**

1. **Statistics of Interface**: Includes total systems, total interfaces, and total connection flows.
   - (1) Total Systems: The total number of systems, including both enabled and disabled ones. Statistic data are updated in real-time when systems are added, enabled, disabled, or deleted.
   - (2) Total Interfaces: The total number of interfaces, including both enabled and disabled ones. Statistic data are updated in real-time when interfaces are added, enabled, disabled, or deleted.
   - (3) Total Connection Flows: The total number of connection flows, including both enabled and disabled ones. Statistic data are updated in real-time when connection flows are added, enabled, disabled, or deleted.

2. **Statistics of Interface Call Volume**: Includes interface call volume and call success rate. Supports filtering queries by this week, this month, or this year.
   - (1) Interface Call Volume: The total historical call count of interfaces. Deleting an interface does not affect the call volume, which only accumulates and does not decrease. Statistic data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also manually refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.
   - (2) Call Success Rate: The total number of successful interface calls/interface call count within a specified time period.

3. **Statistics of Connection Flow Call Volume**: Includes connection flow call volume and call success rate. Supports filtering queries by this week, this month, or this year.
   - (1) Connection Flow Call Volume: The total historical call count of connection flows. Deleting a connection flow does not affect the call volume, which only accumulates and does not decrease. Statistic data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also manually refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.
   - (2) Call Success Rate: The total number of successful connection flow calls/connection flow call count within a specified time period.

4. **Interfaces Distribution**: Count the total number of interfaces in each integration system, ranked from highest to lowest by the number of system interfaces. If there are too many systems, only the top 10 systems will be counted, with the rest grouped under "Other systems". Data are refreshed when a system is added, enabled, disabled, or deleted. Statistic data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also refresh the data manually by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.

5. **Statistics of Interface Call Count**: Counts the number of interfaces/connection flow calls within a specified time period and ranks the top 10 by call count. Supports filtering by today, the last 7 days, or the last 30 days. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.

6. **Statistics of Interface Runtime**: Counts the proportion of interface runtime status within a specified time period. Supports viewing runtime percentages for today, yesterday, and this week. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.

7. **Cache Hit Rate**: Counts on interface cache hits within a specified time period. It counts data for the current day by default and only records time periods with values, omitting periods without values. Supports viewing for today, yesterday, and this week. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.

8. **Top 10 Failed Call Interfaces**: Counts on the top 10 interfaces with the highest call failure rates within a specified time period. It counts data for the current day by default. Supports viewing for today, yesterday, and this week. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can also refresh the data by clicking the Refresh button in the upper-right corner.

9. **Interface Calls Average Duration Ranking**: Counts on the average calls duration of interfaces within a specified time period. It counts data for the current day by default. Supports viewing for today, yesterday, and this week. Data are updated hourly on the hour by default. Users can manually refresh the data by clicking the button in the upper-right corner.
