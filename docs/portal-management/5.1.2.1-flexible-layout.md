# 5.1.2 Flexible Layout Configuration

After dragging components into the layout, you can flexibly move their positions, add multi-tab components, and adjust the height and width by dragging the right, bottom, or bottom-right corner of the component to achieve a reasonable page layout.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Edit a blank page**  
   Select "New Blank Template," and the system defaults to flexible layout.

2. **Drag components**  
   Drag suites or business components from the left navigation, and adjust their height and width by dragging the right, bottom, or bottom-right corner to achieve a reasonable page layout.

3. **Adjust grid size**  
   Select the root directory of the flexible layout container to switch the grid number of the page (which can be understood as the granularity of page width, with no limit on height). A higher grid number allows a larger draggable range for components.

4. **Set column layout**  
   Flexible layout pages can be divided into columns, with options for two-column (left and right) or three-column layouts. Each column can be individually configured for width, grid number, row and column spacing, and can also have custom fill colors and background images.

5. **Use container layout**  
   Flexible layout pages now include a container layout component, similar to fixed layout, allowing containers to be added to the content area with individually set height and width for placing components. The functionality is consistent with fixed layout.

6. **Use alignment guides**  
   When adjusting the height or width of components in flexible layout, guide lines appear to assist in aligning with adjacent components, enabling users to build layouts more properly.
