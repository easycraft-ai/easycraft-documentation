# Chapter 3: Page Layout Planning

For page layout planning, before configuring the portal, you can familiarize yourself with and plan the arrangement of each page component in advance.

The EasyCraft Platform includes several commonly used page layouts for reference. Access the portal management backend, select "Material Library - Page Components - Page Layout" to view the system's built-in page layouts. For details on how to adjust specific page layouts, refer to Section 5.2.2.2 Page Layout Configuration below.
