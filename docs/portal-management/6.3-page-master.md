# 6.3 Page Master

## Using Master Pages

A **Master Page** can be associated with multiple portal pages, allowing shared content across portals, reducing later maintenance and operational costs.



### 1. Create a Master Page

1. Go to **Portal Management Backend** â†’ **Template Center** â†’ **Page Master** directory.  
2. Click the **"New"** button, enter the **Master title**, and proceed to the **layout selection page**.  
   > ğŸ’¡ Tip: Just like creating a new page, you can also select a **Page Template** here.

3. After selecting a layout, enter the **Master Page editing interface**, configure the content, then click **Save and Publish**.  
   > ğŸ’¡ Tip: Only **published** masters can be used in portal pages.



### 2. Use a Master Page

1. In the **Portal Configuration**, create a **new page**, then click the **"Edit Page"** button.  
2. Select the **"Page Master"** tab and choose a published master from the list.

3. The page will now **inherit content** from the master and **cannot be edited directly**.  
   > ğŸ’¡ Tip: Pages referencing masters are **read-only**; to change their content, edit the master page directly.



### 3. Edit a Master Page

1. Go to **Template Center** â†’ **Page Masters**, and click the **"Edit"** button next to a master.  
2. Modify the master content as needed, then **Save and Publish**.

   > ğŸ’¡ Tip: After publishing, **all child pages** linked to this master will reflect the changes automatically.



### 4. Delete a Master Page

1. Navigate to the **Master Management** list, hover over the master to reveal operation buttons.  
2. Click **"Delete Mast**
