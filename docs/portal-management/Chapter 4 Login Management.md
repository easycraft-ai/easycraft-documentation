## 4.2 Pop-up Notifications
Configure the login pop-up. After publishing, you need to wait for the background scheduled task (executed hourly) to run before users can see the pop-up content when logging in.

The specific steps are as follows:
1. Go to Login Management - Pop-up Notifications, click "Create" on the right, and select a pop-up template.
2. Enter the pop-up title and content in the preview area on the left, modify the font, text color, pop-up background image, etc., and preview the effect directly.
3. After selecting a pop-up template, enter the pop-up configuration page. The configuration area on the right allows you to set basic information such as pop-up frequency, notification scope, notification time, recipients, and style. The pop-up will notify the specified people within the set time range according to the configured frequency.
   - Tip: Remember to fill in the notification time; otherwise, the pop-up will not appear.
4. Return to the pop-up list and publish the newly created pop-up.
   - When the pop-up maintainer field is empty, everyone can maintain it. After specifying a person, only the specified person and the creator can maintain it.
   - Newly published pop-ups will take effect after 1 hour. If you want it to take effect immediately, switch to the system administrator account and manually execute the "Login Pop-up Scheduled Task." After execution, click to view the scheduled task details and check the logs to see if it was successful.
5. Switch to a regular account to log in and view the pop-up.
