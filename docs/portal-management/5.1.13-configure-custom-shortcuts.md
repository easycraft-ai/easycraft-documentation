# 5.1.13 Configure Custom Shortcuts

1. If a portal is configured with a custom shortcuts component, this component allows users to customize the display, hide, and sorting of shortcuts within the component. It also supports administrators locking certain shortcuts, preventing users from customizing them.

   In portal configuration, add the **Custom Shortcuts** component.  
   **Tip:** On the portal editing page, in the left component selection area, you can search for "Custom Shortcuts" and select to add the custom shortcuts component.

2. Click the **Settings** of the component to configure and select the data source for custom shortcuts.  
   The data source comes from graphic-text shortcuts in custom content management.

   **Tip 1: Explanation of the three configuration areas:**  
   - **Locked Area:** Shortcuts added to this area cannot be sorted or hidden by users.  
   - **Display Area:** Shortcuts in this area are visible to users by default and can be sorted or hidden as desired.  
   - **Hidden Area:** Shortcuts in this area are not visible to users by default, but users can choose to add them to the display area.

   **Tip 2:** Once a user has customized the shortcuts, any changes made by the administrator to the default display and hide settings will not affect the user's customizations.

4. When users access the portal, they can customize the shortcuts.  
   **Tips:** Users can set shortcuts to show or hide and can sort the displayed shortcuts.
