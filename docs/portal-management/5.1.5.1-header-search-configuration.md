# 5.1.5.1 Header Search Configuration

1. Configure the search function in the header content area.

2. Search Scope Configuration  
   1) In the connected EKP system, under **Search Function Configuration > Default Search Module Configuration**, select the business module.  
   2) In the EasyCraft header content area, under **Search Scope Configuration**, select the search module.

3. After saving and publishing the portal, check the user side. The user-side header search box allows selecting the search scope, with options being the business modules selected in Demo. The default option is **"All."**

4. Search Address Configuration  
   - **System default:**  
     When "System default" is checked, the search address in the header will be the one configured in the backend.  
     > **Note:** The system-configured search address is only effective when using EasyCraft full-text search. Log in to the backend as sysadmin and configure the system search address in the **Backend Management Center > System Configuration**. Selecting "System default" allows you to control whether the search results page opens in a new tab or within the content area.

   - **Custom:**  
     When "Custom" is checked, users can define their own search address. For example, entering `"www.google.com"` in the text box will redirect searches to the Baidu search engine.
