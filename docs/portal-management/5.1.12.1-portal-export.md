# 5.1.12.1 Portal Export

- **Single Portal Export**

  1. Go to the portal management backend, select the portal in the portal configuration list, and click **[Export]**.  
     **Tip:** If the network is unstable and the exported portal contains large files such as audio or video, clicking export may take a few minutes to package before the file download pop-up appears.  
  
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
    <img src="/img/Portal Export.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
  </div>

  2. Select the storage path for the exported portal.  
  
  **Tips:** Portal export packages portal information and configurations, page templates, data sources including custom content, sample data from the asset library, custom components, custom headers, custom footers, and custom design packs.

- **Batch Portal Export**

  Go to the portal management backend, select multiple portals in the portal configuration list, and click **[Batch Export]**.
