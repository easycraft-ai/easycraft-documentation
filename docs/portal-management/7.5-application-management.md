# 7.5 Application Management

# Application Management in Portal Configuration

Under **Portal Configuration - Custom Content**, add an **Application Management** tab to display all systems passed from the unified authentication system. Users can also perform the **Add System** operation.

This section explains how to configure accessible systems and the user-side effects of using these systems.

## 1. Configure Application Management

1. Access the portal management backend, select the **Custom Content - Accessible Systems** menu, and click on **Access Permissions**.  
   - After configuring permissions, all accessible systems will use these permissions.  
   - Permission sources can be set to **Local System Permissions** or **Third-party System Permissions**.  
     - Selecting local system permissions will adopt the "Accessible Users" system permissions from **System Settings**.  
     - Third-party system permissions are provided by IDM for accessible users. When creating a new system, fill in the corresponding code for the third-party system.

2. Click **Create New System**.

3. In the new system pop-up window:  
   - Fill in the system name, link, select system category, input a description of the system, and change the icon.  
   - After saving, the new system will appear in the list.  
   - **Note:** System names must be unique.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/Custom Pages.png" alt="Portal Diagram" width="800" />
</div>

4. Click **Categories Management** to create new categories, edit, or delete existing ones.  
   - Category names must be unique.

## 2. Accessible System Portal Configuration Page and User-side Display

1. Enter the portal, edit the page, and drag the accessible system component into the container.  
   - Component location: **Local System > Portal Management**.

2. In the content area, select what the accessible system component displays on the user side.  
   - The selected content comes from data in Content Management.

3. After saving and publishing the portal, the user-side will display the accessible system effect.
