# 7.2 Multi-level Navigation

# Multi-level Navigation

This section explains how to add multi-level navigation data sources, reference configurations on the portal, and display the multi-level navigation effect.

## 1. Manage Multi-level Navigation Data

- Go to the portal management backend.
- Select **Custom Content - Multi-level Navigation** from the menu to enter the multi-level navigation list page, where you can maintain multi-level navigation data.
- Click **Create** to enter the multi-level navigation addition page.
- Configure basic information and link addresses.
- Set the navigation menu's remark field and access permissions. Users not listed cannot view this navigation or its sub-level menus.
- After enabling and saving the data synchronization feature, modifications are not allowed. Customizing components using this multi-level navigation data source will simultaneously modify other identical data sources and users.

**Tips:**

- When creating multi-level navigation, the link title and icon will display in the multi-level navigation component.
- The link address is optional; if left blank, clicking the link title will not redirect.
- Use the following buttons for link management:
  - **Add Sibling:** Insert a new link at the same level after the current link.
  - **Add Child:** Insert a new link as a child of the current link.
  - **Delete:** Remove the current link and its child links.
- You can drag and sort link address rows at the same or different levels. Moving a main navigation moves its child navigations as well.
- Multi-level navigation supports **source code mode**, allowing direct copying and pasting of pre-configured multi-level navigation link addresses.
- In the navigation settings button on the right, configure the floating window content for this navigation menu to display in specific components.
