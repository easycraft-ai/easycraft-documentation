# 5.1.4.2 Business Component Configuration

## Business Components

You can select standard data sources from various business modules, third-party systems, and integrated component data sources built by the integration platform.

### Data Source Types

- **Business Module Data Sources**  
  Standard data sources provided by each business module.

- **Third-Party System Data Sources**  
  Custom data sources uploaded by third-party systems.

- **Integrated Component Data Sources**  
  Configurable component data sources built through the integration platform interface.



### Component Selection Method

- In the **left component navigation**, select the component source system.
- Filter components by system and module.
- Drag them into the corresponding container on the page.
- Or directly search for the component name and drag it into the container.

> 💡 **Tip**:  
> - Hover over components on the left to view style previews.  
> - When dragging a component directly, the **default style is the first one**.



## Appearance Configuration

Explanation of appearance-related configuration parameters:

| **Field**        | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **Display**       | Predefined styles optimized per component. Usually no need to change. |
| **Inner Spacing** | Space between component and content area. Can be set individually. |
| **Fill**          | Background color or image. Default follows the theme, or customize it. |
| **Height**        | Default is content-adaptive, but fixed height is recommended for layout consistency. |
| **Border**        | Show/hide border based on page style. |
| **Corner Radius** | Customize corner roundness uniformly or per corner. |



## Content Configuration

| **Field**        | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **Title**         | Whether to display content in the title area. |
| **Tab Title**     | Customizable component title. |
| **Tab Subtitle**  | Subtitle in the component header. |
| **Tab Icon**      | Icon shown before the title. |
| **Content**       | Includes configuration for data source, number of data items, and data fields. Varies by component. |



## Style Configuration

| **Field**         | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Component**     | Presentation modes; varies by component. See all modes under `Interface Components > Presentation`. |
| **Refresh Time**  | Set via `encrypt.key` in bootstrap config. |
| **Action Button** | Whether to display operational buttons. |
| **Other Configs** | Additional display tweaks depending on the component. Updates appear in real-time. |



## Permission Configuration

| **Field**             | **Description** |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Custom**             | Enable via Page Settings > Permissions. Allows user-side customization/deletion. |
| **Accessible Users**   | Select individuals, departments, roles, or groups. Empty = visible to everyone. |
| **Non-Accessible Users** | Restrict visibility by user/group. Empty = visible to everyone. |



## Multi-Tab Components

When multiple components are added to a single container, it's called a **multi-tab component**.

- Configure **content** and **style** for each tab individually.
- **Appearance** settings are shared across all tabs.
- Components can be added, removed, or reconfigured at any time.

> 💡 **Tip**:  
> After configuring the component, click **Save** and **Preview** (top-right of the page) to see the actual effect.  
> - **Real Data**: Calls live system interface.  
> - **Sample Data**: Static demo content.



## Undo Function

During page editing:

- Click the **Undo** button in the top-right to view a list of previous operations.
- Allows step-by-step reversal of actions.

> ⚠️ **Important**:  
> - After saving the page, **undo history is still available**.  
> - Once you **exit and re-enter**, undo history is cleared.  
> - **Header/Footer configuration** is not part of the undo history.



## Final Step

4. After configuring the page:
   - **Save** it.
   - **Exit editing mode**.
   - Continue editing other pages to complete the full configuration process.
