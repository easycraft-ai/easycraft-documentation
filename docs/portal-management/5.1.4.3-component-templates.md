# 5.1.4.3 Component Templates

        

## Component Templates

Pre-configured components can be saved as templates and directly used from the component template list.

1. Drag a single component into the container, and configure the appearance, content, and display-related parameters for the component.

2. In the component appearance settings area, save the configured component as a template.

3. During page configuration, select the **Component Template** tab, and drag the recently saved template component into the configuration area.
