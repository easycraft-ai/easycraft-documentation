# 10.3 Personal information configuration

1) Here you can control whether the floating window toggle is displayed in user personal settings; when configured as disabled, the floating window function toggle will not appear in the user-side personal settings > portal configuration, meaning users cannot enable the floating window function. 
2) Enable the default portal switch. Users can set a designated portal as the default in the portal dropdown list. User settings take precedence over the default visitor portal set by the administrator. When disabled, the default visitor portal will be restored.
