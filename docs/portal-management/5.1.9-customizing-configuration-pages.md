# 5.1.9 Customizing Configuration Pages

The portal settings offer two user customization methods in custom content: simple editing and advanced editing. - In simple editing mode, users can only drag components to adjust their position, hide components, and sort or hide components under multi-tab components. - Advanced editing allows users to add components, delete components, adjust component positions, modify components, and also copy or delete custom pages. - Both simple editing and advanced editing modes support page pushing. When an administrator updates a backend page, they need to manually recommend pushing a page update reminder or forward to overwrite the user's custom page.
