# 7.3 Recommended Topics

# Recommended Topics

Recommended topics are images with link addresses. Their display ratio can be configured to fit different-sized sections on the page. This is typically used for recommended topic components.

This section explains how to add a recommended topic data source, reference and configure recommended topics on the portal, and display the rendering effect.

## 1. Add Recommended Topic Data Source

- Go to the portal management backend.
- Select the **Custom Content - Recommended Topics** menu.
- Click **Create**.
- Configure the recommended topic image, image link, and the applicable scenario ratio.

**Tips:**  
- Check the **Use Scenario** button to enable the image to automatically adapt to different ratios based on the container size.  
- Uncheck it to display the image at its original size without adapting to the container.

## 2. Add Recommended Topics on the Portal (Reference Data Source)

1. Go to **Portal Configuration > Edit Portal > Edit Page**.
2. Select **This System > Portal Management**.
3. Drag the recommended topic component into the page container.
4. Under the **Content** tab, select the newly added recommended topic data source (supports multiple selections).

**Note:**  
- Featured topics are used for page display effects.  
- After selecting multiple recommended topic images, the images will switch in a carousel manner on the page.
