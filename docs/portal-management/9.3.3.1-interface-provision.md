# 9.3.3.1 Interface Provision

# Portal Module Extension Point

To allow the **portal module** to know which modules have configured data sources,  
the corresponding extension points need to be implemented by this module.



## Extension Point

```java
package com.easycraft.sys.portal.annotation;

@PorletPoint(sysCode="ekp-cloud")
 

 ```
The entity service corresponding to the data source needs to implement the interface com.easycraft.sys.portal.api.IPortletApi to obtain data details during editing.
