# Chapter 9 Portal Integration

# Overview: Portal Integration

**Portal integration** refers to configuring data source connections from external systems for portal components. Currently, three connection methods are supported:

### • Internal Connection
- Component data sources from **this system** and **EasyCraft business modules**.
- Supports **direct synchronization** through internal interfaces.

### • Third-Party Connection
- Supports **manual integration** of third-party systems.
- Requires **developing custom component data sources**, then uploading them to the EasyCraft platform.

### • Platform Integration
- Supports **adding new platform-integrated systems**.
- Configuration is done through the **interface** by selecting **integrated platform interface data sources**.
