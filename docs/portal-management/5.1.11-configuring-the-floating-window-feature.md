# 5.1.11 Configuring the Floating Window Feature

The floating window feature is a client-side function. After enabling it in the personal center, all links on portal components will open in a floating window when accessed by the user.

1. Users enter the portal, select **Personal Center > Personal Settings > Portal Settings** in the header, and enable the floating window feature. 

2. After enabling the floating window feature, a floating window icon appears in the lower-right corner of the portal page. 

3. When users open a new link from the portal, it will be displayed in a floating window style, as shown in the figure.

- In the upper-right corner of the floating window, click the minimize button to collapse the link into the floating window icon.
- In the upper-right corner of the floating window, click the maximize button to display the floating window in full screen.
- In the upper-right corner of the floating window, click the close button to close the floating window.
- In the upper-right corner of the floating window, click the "..." button to enable batch operations, allowing all opened links in the floating window icon to be processed in bulk.
- In the upper-right corner of the floating window, click the "..." button to disable the floating window feature. Portal links will then open according to the portal's configured method. The floating window feature can be re-enabled in **Personal Center**.
- Hold the mouse button on the floating window title to drag it up or down. Place the mouse on the borders of the floating window to resize it.
