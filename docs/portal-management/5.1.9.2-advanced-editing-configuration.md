# 5.1.9.2 Advanced Editing Configuration

1) Set the page to allow user customization and copying. The portal administrator enters the portal configuration backend, switches to portal editing mode, hovers over the page title, sets page properties, checks the "User Customization" option, enables page copying, and clicks **OK**. 
2) Set page components to allow user customization and deletion. Hover over the page title, click the edit icon to enter the page editing screen, select the **Settings > Permissions** option for a component, and configure whether users can customize or delete the component on the page. 
Tip: Each component on the page must be individually configured to allow customization and deletion. If a component is not configured, it cannot be customized.
3) Save the page, exit page editing, click the publish button on the portal to publish the portal. 
4) For regular users' personal settings, click **Customize** to enter page editing mode. Users can customize page content, such as selecting to add other components, dragging components to rearrange their positions, and configuring existing components on the page (if the component allows customization). 
5) After customizing the page, you can set it as the homepage, copy the page, or reset the page to restore the default page, among other operations. 
6) Click cancel button to return to the portal homepage, displaying the copied customized page. 
7) After an administrator updates the content of a page with customization enabled, they need to send a push notification to prompt all users who have customized the page, asking if they want to update with the administrator's changes. 
8) When users access the portal page, they receive a recommended push notification, as shown in the figure. Users can preview the page configured by the administrator and choose to ignore or update it. 
9) When users access the portal page, they receive a forward notification, as shown in the figure. The user's customized page content is updated to match the admin backend.
