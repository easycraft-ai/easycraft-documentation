# Chapter 1: Portal Configuration Process

The portal is what employees interact with most in their daily work, making its configuration highly important. If the configuration approach is not planned—such as determining the number of pages a portal requires, identifying the components each page needs, etc.—it may lead to repeated adjustments during configuration, consuming a significant amount of time. Therefore, when configuring a portal, it is recommended to follow the steps below to create a portal efficiently and its pages that fit the intended scenario.

1. **Plan the company's portal structure.** Determine page content and select the portal style mainly based on the target users.
   - **Portal target users:** A single portal can be made accessible to multiple users, and a single user can view various portals. For specific configuration methods, refer to Section 6.2, "Designing the Portal Structure Diagram." Adjust the page content to match how users usually work.
   - **Portal style selection:** The portal includes five built-in standard styles—Full Screen Left Navigation, Full Screen Left Header, Centered Left Navigation, Centered No Navigation, and Windows 8 Template. The style template must be selected before configuration, as it cannot be changed after the portal is created. (Step 1)

2. **Plan the layout for each page.** Once content is defined, determine the containers for displaying it—i.e., the page layout. Estimate how each page will look. The specific presentation can be adjusted based on the components included on the page. For reference on built-in page layouts, see Section 6.3, "Page Layout Planning." During actual portal configuration, layouts can be adjusted. For specific methods, refer to below. (Step 2)

3. **Based on the portal plan, finalize content and presentation styles, and upload required image assets.** For specific methods, refer to Section 6.9, "Asset Management."

4. **Following the content presentation and layout planning from Steps 1 and 2, configure shortcuts, multi-level navigation, recommended topics, and custom page data sources in Content Management.** For specific methods, refer to Section 6.7, "Content Management."

5. **Following the portal design structure from Step 1, proceed with portal creation and configuration.**
