# 5.1.5 Portal Header and Footer Configuration

1. On the portal editing page, click the settings button next to the portal name to enable or disable the header and footer (the portal enables headers and footers by default).

5. When the footer is enabled, enter the editing mode of any portal page, select the footer, click settings, and configure the footer content.
