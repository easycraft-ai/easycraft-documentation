# 5.1.3 Fixed Layout Configuration

In fixed layout, you can drag in multiple container layouts, set container width, spacing, and background color, and delete nested containers. When dragging components into containers, their height and width cannot be flexibly adjusted; instead, component height must be set in the appearance settings to meet page layout requirements.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Switch to fixed layout**  
   In the upper left corner of the page, switch the layout to a fixed layout, select one basic layout template, and enter the fixed layout page editing area.  
   *Tip: If you switch layouts, components may become disorganized. Please switch carefully.*

2. **Set container properties**  
   Click the container to set the container width, spacing, and background color, and to delete embedded containers.

3. **Drag containers**  
   Hover the mouse over the corresponding container. Based on the dotted line nesting relationship, hold the mouse to drag the container to the desired location.

4. **Add and configure components**  
   Drag the left-side suite or business component into the container, then set the component layout spacing and height.
