# 5.1.14 Configure Smart Pages

# Configuration Overview

Primarily provided by AIP, smart recommendation components and smart tags are integrated with portal configuration to assemble smart pages.

- **Smart Recommendation Components:**  
  Through AIP services, smart recommendation components are provided. These components use common recommendation strategies to suggest relevant content to users.

  **Smart components include:**  
  Headline recommendations, internal knowledge/industry knowledge/knowledge repository recommendations, today's work recommendations, related work recommendations, scenario recommendations, and application recommendations.

  **Common recommendation strategies:**  
  - **Popularity-based recommendation:** Recommend content based on the most clicked or searched items in the last 7 days or 1 month.  
  - **Suggestions among users with the same identity:** Recommend content preferred by users with the same identity tags.  
  - **Cross-recommendation based on similar behaviors:** Recommend other content viewed by users who also viewed this item.  
  - **User profile-based recommendation:** Recommend content personalized according to user tags.

- **Smart Pages:**  
  The portal management provides smart pages with intelligent tags. The AIP service matches smart pages with user tags to display the most relevant content.



## Prerequisites

The AIP service must be deployed, and the intelligent service platform must be configured with system settings, tag settings, and smart portal recommendation settings as described in the **"AIP Administrator Operation Manual."**



## Configuration Steps

1. In the portal configuration of portal management, create a smart page and multiple recommendation pages, then save.

2. Edit the recommendation page. In the component navigation area, select the **business component** tab, filter the "**EASYCRAFT Digital Work Platform System - Intelligent Recommendation**" module, drag in intelligent recommendation components, configure component height and content, preview, and save.  
   *Note:* The configuration of intelligent components is similar to other business components in the portal.

3. Exit page editing and configure tags for the smart page.

4. After configuring all intelligent recommendation page content and tags, publish the portal.

5. Go to **Intelligent Service > System Configuration > General Configuration > User Information Management** to configure intelligent tags for users.

6. When users access the portal, they will only see the most relevant intelligent recommendation page.
