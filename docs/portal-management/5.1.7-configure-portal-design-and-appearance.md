# 5.1.7 Configure Portal Design and Appearance

The system provides multiple design styles, each with several different skin options. The backend can configure the default portal design and whether users are allowed to switch design and appearance.
 1. After entering the portal editing page, select the "Design and Appearance" tab to switch the default portal design and appearance. 
 2. After checking the "Allow regular users to change designs" option, a "Design and Appearance" operation option will appear in the personal settings page for regular users after the portal is published. Regular users can flexibly switch their design styles.
