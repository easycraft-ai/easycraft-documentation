A suite is a collection of component styles that share a similar appearance.

Suite categories: Basic, Carousel, Navigation, List, Ranking, Charts, Statistics, DIY.

Differences between suites and business components:

- Suites are styles and are separate from data sources. After selecting a suite style, choose to configure a system-preset data source in the corresponding format or a custom unified data source in the content area.

- Business components are data sources. Selecting a business component determines the data source interface, and you can switch between all styles that match this data source.
